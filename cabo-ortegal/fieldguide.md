## 1. Introduction

The Cabo Ortegal Complex is known to the mantle community for its ultramafic massifs that preserve some of the best outcrops of pyroxenite among orogenic massifs worldwide (**Fig_layered-pyroxenites-1**). The main objective of this two-day excursion is to showcase some of these outcrops, which belong to the high-pressure (HP), high-temperature (HT) units, and get an overview of the geology of the complex. 

- The first day focusses on the mantle rocks exposed in the largest and most lithologically heterogeneous massif of *Herbeira*.
- The second day covers the main petrological and structural features of other HP-HT units of the complex (granulites and eclogites).

It is noteworthy that most of the Cabo Ortegal Complex is part of the *Xeoparque do Cabo Ortegal*, officially established as a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2024. This designation aims to promote and preserve the outstanding rock formations and outcrops of the complex, as well as rias, islets, coves, beaches, and lagoons of significant geomorphological interest. The park spans 800 km² of land and marine areas rich in biodiversity, cultural heritage and gastronomic traditions.

## 2. Geological setting

The Cabo Ortegal Complex ([Vogel, 1967](https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/505641)), located in NW Spain, is part of the Iberian section of the Variscan Orogen (**Fig_geological-setting**). Along with the Appalachian (Alleghanian) and Ural belts, the Variscan Orogen records the collision of Laurussia (_i.e._ Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia) and Gondwana during the Paleozoic (_e.g._, Matte 2002). The Variscan Orogen specifically represents a Late Paleozoic belt that extends from Morocco through Iberia to Central Europe (**Fig_geological-setting_a**).

**Fig_geological-setting**. **a.** Map of the Variscan Orogen in Western and Central Europe prior to Mesozoic times, showing the location of the NW Iberian complexes and other European Variscides. Adapted from Franke (1989), Lefort (1989), Newman and Max (1989) and Martínez-Catalán (2011). Note that the northern front of the orogen (Laurussian realm, in brown), is clearly delineated, particularly from Germany to England and in the SW of the Iberian Peninsula, where the South Portuguese Zone is interpreted as a detached Laurussian terrane. In contrast, the S front of the orogen (Gondwanan realm, in yellow and green), has been significantly reworked in the Cenozoic by the Alpine orogeny, partly hindering the correlation of pre-Mesozoic terranes across Europe. **b.** Map of the pre-Mesozoic outcrops of the Iberian Peninsula among which the Iberian Massif is the largest. **c.** Classical tectonic zonation of the Iberian Massif highlighting the allochthonous complexes (in dark green) of the *Galicia-Trás-os-Montes Zone* (GTMZ), which include the Cabo Ortegal Complex. Based on Simancas (2019).

In the geology of the Iberian Peninsula, the Cabo Ortegal Complex forms part of the Iberian Massif, the largest exposure of pre-Mesozoic rocks in continental Europe (**Fig_geological-setting_b**), which here defines an orogen-scale fold (_i.e._ orocline) with the foreland fold-and-thrust belt at its core. It is more specifically part of the so-called Allochthonous Complexes of the *Galicia-Trás-os-Montes Zone* (GTMZ; Farias _et al._, 1987), which include Cabo Ortegal, Malpica-Tuy and Órdenes in NW Spain, Bragança and Morais in Portuga (**Fig_geological-setting_c**). These complexes consist of various metamorphic units representing peri-Gondwanan terranes accreted to the Gondwanan margin during the Variscan collision.

The Cabo Ortegal Complex stands out among the Allochthonous Complexes of the GTMZ for preserving the most complete section and best outcrops of high-pressure (HP), high-temperature (HT) metamorphic rocks. It consists of two main tectonic units referred to as the Upper and Lower Tectonic Units (**Fig_map-Cabo-Ortegal**), distinguished by their metamorphic grade (Marcos _et al._, 2002; Arenas _et al._, 2014a). These units are mostly correlated with the subdivisions of the other allochthonous complexes of NW Iberia and some of the European Variscides (_e.g._, Martínez Catalán _et al._, 2020)

#### Lower Tectonic Unit

This unit comprises a suite of low- to high-pressure rocks without high-T imprints, interpreted as remnants of the subducted Gondwanan margin and arc-derived rocks of the peri-Gondwanan transitional crust, which were deformed and exhumed in a subduction channel. It is typically divided into three sub-units (_e.g._, Marcos _et al._, 2002; Arenas _et al._, 2014):

1. **Ophiolitic Unit**. This unit mostly consists of monotonous amphibolites and Grt-bearing amphibolites of meta-gabbroic origin. They form the *Purrido* (Sánchez Martínez _et al._, 2011) and *Peña Escrita* amphibolites and the *Moeche* unit, which consists of greenschists with few metagabbroic inclusions (Arenas _et al._, 2014b). These rocks are interpreted as dismembered slices of ophiolitic units. Their regional significance is far more limited than that of better-preserved ophiolitic units in the other allochthonous complexes (particularly in Órdenes; Arenas, 2015), which allow for the discrimination of two main age groups: Cambro-Ordovician and Early Devonian ophiolites (Martínez-Catalán _et al._, 2019). The Cabo Ortegal occurrences belong to the latter group.

2. ***Somozas Mélange* Unit**. This unit is a 500-m-thick sheet of intensely deformed rocks with both continental (meta-igneous and meta-sedimentary blocks) and oceanic (close-packed and broken pillow breccias) affinities. It represents a tectonic, serpentinite-matrix mélange (Arenas _et al._, 2009, Novo-Fernández _et al._, 2016, and references therein).

3.  **Basal Unit**. Poorly exposed in the Cabo Ortegal Complex (*Espasante* formation), this unit consists of felsic orthogneisses, amphibolites and minor retro-eclogites. It represents parts of the distal Gondwanan margin which record HP metamorphism under low- to intermediate-temperature conditions.

#### Upper Tectonic Unit

This unit is the main focus of this excursion and is described in detail in **Section 3** and **4**. It consists of several strongly deformed rock units that have experienced high pressures (> 1.7 GPa) and high temperatures (> 700 ºC). It contains five main mappable rock types: (**1**) ultramafics peridotites and pyroxenites (and subordinate lithologies); (**2**) ultramafic cumulates (pyrigarnites, hornblendites); (**3**) Opx-free Grt granulites (mafic to felsic) and amphibolites; (**4**) eclogites and (**5**) quartzo-feldspathic gneisses, with variable degrees of retrogression. 

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/hp-ht-units.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_hp-ht-units**. Simplified map of the HP-HT units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex showing the location of the ultramafic massifs. *Granulites* refer to Opx-free Grt granulites and amphibolites. *Si-poor granulites* refer to the ultramafic cumulates (pyrigarnites, horblendites and pyribolites).  See **Section 4** for more details.

The ultramafic cumulates and most of the granulites form together the *Bacariza* (or *Vacariza*) formation to the W, whereas the E granulite body is known as the *Candelaria* formation (see **Section 4.1**). The eclogites are known as the *Concepenido* formation.  The gneisses occur as the *Chímparra* gneiss to W, and as the *Banded* gneiss (and *Cariño* gneiss) formations to the E (see **Section 4.3**). 

Some authors further divide the Upper Tectonic Unit based on the similarity of their lithological sequence but differing amphibolite facies overprint hindering earlier HP-HT history (_e.g._, Galán and Marcos, 2000):
- *La Capelada* (or *Concepenido-La Capelada*) Unit, which includes the ultramafic massifs, *Bacariza* granulites, *Concepenido* eclogites and the *Banded gneiss* formation;
- *Cedeira* Unit, which includes the *Chímparra* gneiss and the *Candelaria* formations.

In contrast to the Lower Tectonic Unit, the cartographic pattern of the Upper Tectonic Unit shows a consistent lithological sequence, interpreted by some authors as a continuous lithospheric section of lower crust and upper mantle (_e.g._, Marcos _et al._, 2002, Brown _et al._, 2009), while others separate the different mappable units by ductile thrusts (_e.g._, Abalos _et al._, 2003 and references therein).

## 3. The ultramafic massifs

### 3.1 Field aspect & petrography

Ultramafic rocks are mainly exposed in the *Herbeira* (12.5 km<sup>2</sup>), *Limo* (6.6 km<sup>2</sup>) and *Uzal* (3.6 km<sup>2</sup>) massifs (**Fig_ultramafics**), but also in ~40 sparse harzburgitic outcrops within *Bacariza* granulites, interpreted by some authors as tectonic windows. The massifs are always in contact with granulites except on the W edge of the *Uzal* massif, where they are in tectonic contact with the *Chímparra* gneiss.

Minor ultramafic rocks occur along the shear zone (*Carreiro* shear zone) that represents the contact between the Upper and Lower Tectonic (Ophiolitic) unit (Azcárraga _et al._, 2002). Among them, mylonitic garnet (Grt)-facies harzburgites and olivine (Ol) orthopyroxenites have been interpreted as buried serpentinite indicating HP conditions up to 3 GPa (Gil Ibarguchi _et al._, 1999). These rocks are not further discussed here.

**Fig_hp-ht-units**. Simplified map of the HP-HT units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex showing the location of the ultramafic rocks and corresponding excursion stops.

The ultramafic rocks are primarily composed of harzburgites which dominate in the *Limo* and *Uzal* massifs. In contrast, the *Herbeira* massif preserves a mucher great lithological diversity, including harzburgites, pyroxenites, dunites and chromitites.

#### Harzburgites

As in *Limo* and *Uzal*, harzburgites constitute a mantle tectonite in the E part of the *Herbeira* massif (**Fig_harzburgites**). These rocks are predominantly amphibole (Amp)- and chlorite (Chl)-bearing Spl-facies harzburgites with < 2 % clinopyroxene (Cpx), strongly serpentinized (up to 70 % in extreme cases).

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/harzburgites.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_harzburgites**. **a.** Relatively fresh harzburgite outcrop at the bottom of the cliffs near the NW boundary of the *Herbeira* massif; note the strong foliation outlined by aligned Opx porphyroclasts and Chl-rich trails. **b.** Serpentinized harzburgite representative of inland exposures in the *Herbeira* and *Limo* massifs; **c.** Detail of bastitized Opx porphyroclasts and Chl in the matrix. **d.** Strongly serpentinized harzburgite and thin pyroxenites in an inland outcrop ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)).

Harzburgites exhibit a porphyroclastic texture with 5-10mm orthopyroxene (Opx) porphyroblasts embedded in an Ol matrix (**Fig_harzburgite-texture**). They contain up to 30  of Mg-hornblende and < 10 % of Spl occurring as < 5 mm grains. Spinel (Spl), Amp, and Chl, often associated with magnetite (Mag), define the schistosity.

Less voluminous peridotitic lithologies such as lherzolites and wehrlites occur sporadically. They are observed with diffuse contacts to pyroxenites in the pyroxenite-rich domain, in the mantle tectonite at the bottom of the *Herbeira cliffs* (**Fig_lherzolite-outcrop**) and associated with dunite and chromitites above the pyroxenite-rich domain. They were described as “impregnated” dunites and harzburgites by Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi (1991).

#### Pyroxenites

Pyroxenites are particularly abundant (80–90%) in a 3-km long, 300-m-thick domain (potentially consisting of one or several lenticular bodies) exposed in the W cliffs of the *Herbeira* massif (see **Section 6.1** and **Fig_map-herbeira**). They generally occur interlayered with dunites or as massives outcrops with lateral extension of individual layers exceeding 100 m (Girardeau _et al._, 1989, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991). The Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites have been classified based on their field occurence as follows (**Fig_pyroxenites**; [Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064), [Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)): 

- **Type 1**. Ol-clinopyroxenites and websterite, occurring as branching layers preserving dunite lenses;
- **Type 2**. Massive websterites forming thick layers (up to 3 m);
- **Type 3**. Thinly foliated, amphibolitized pyroxenites;
- **Type 4**. Subordinate Opx-rich websterites and orthopyroxenites, often outcropping near chromitites.

**Fig_pyroxenites**. Representrative outcrops of the different types of pyroxenites in the *Herbeira* massif ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)).

Representative modal compositions are approx. 30–80 % Cpx, 0–45 % Opx, 5-40 % Amp, 2–8 % Spl, 6–7 % Grt when present, < 1 % base-metal sulfides and 1-2 % Chl when present. Olivine is mostly restricted to type-1 and type-4 pyroxenites. Cpx/Opx ratios decrease from type-1 and-3 pyroxenites through type-2 to type-4 pyroxenites (**Fig_pyroxenites-mode**). Amphibole is most abundant in type-3 pyroxenites and least abundant in type-1 pyroxenites.

**Fig_pyroxenites-mode**. Modal compositions of the different types of pyroxenites in Cabo Ortegal. Thin layers (< 5-cm thick) are indicated as their modal composition may be strongly affected by mechanical mixing with the host peridotites ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)).

Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites have medium- to coarse-grained granoblastic to porphyroclastic textures (**Fig_pyroxenite-textures**). Pyroxenes (Cr-diopside and enstatite) occur as 1-5 mm exsolved porphyroclasts with complex boundaries and as 50–800 μm exsolution-free neoblasts. Olivine either occurs as relatively fresh dunitic lenses, as interstitial trails associated with Spl and Amp, or as inclusions in pyroxene (Px).

Cross-polarized light images illustrating the textures and mineral assemblages in the Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)). **a.** Trails of interstitial Ol in a porphyroclastic Ol websterite (type 1). **b.** Porphyroclastic websterite (type 2). **c.** Abundant Amp replacement along cleavages in a Cpx porphyroclast and in the matrix of a clinopyroxenite (type 3). **d.** Granoblastic websterite (type 2). **e.** Abundant Amp replacement along grain boundaries in a granoblastic websterite (type 3). **f.** Kinked Opx porphyroclasts in an Opx-rich websterite (type 4). Note the Amp (I) in textural equilibrium with Px (**d**).

Spinel is found as rounded enclosed grains and large (rarely idiomorphic, but often exsolved; **Fig_spinel-exsolution**) interstitial grains, associated with sulfides. It is also observed as part of a mesh of exsolved needles associated with Px and Amp. This mesh commonly  delineate curved-shaped domains with Px porphyroclasts leaving exsolution-free rims and halos around Spl grains(**Fig_spinel-textures**).

Garnet occurs only in some massive websterites (type 2), either in equilibrium with Px, as coronas around Spl (**Fig_grt-corona**) or with symplectites of Spl and pyroxenes (± Amp, Ilm; **Fig_symplectite**).

Amphibole occurs either as pre- to syn-kinematic xenomorphic grains in textural equilibrium with Cpx (Amp I; (**Fig_pyroxenite-textures_d**).  or more commonly as clearly post-kinematic (_i.e._ internally undeformed), replacing Cpx (± Spl) among matrix minerals, often as idiomorphic crystals (**Fig_amphibole_c-f**). It is locally associated with vermicular Spl (**Fig_spinel-texture_d-f**) and replacing Px exsolution lamellae (**Fig_amphibole_a-b**) . These two textural generations, confirmed by electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) data, are respectively interpreted as evidence of late-magmatic crystallization of residual melts (Amp I) and of hydration and retrograde metamorphism (Amp II). Extreme cases of amphibolitization produce hornblendites with poikilitic textures.

Note  the Spl exsolution mesh restricted to parts of Px porphyroclasts and vermicular Spl associated with Amp.

Accessory Chl occurs often associated with Spl after or in textural equilibrium with Amp (**Fig_chlorite**). Base-metal sulfides are relatively fresh (< 20 % of alteration products such as Fe oxyhydrodrides) and occur as either rounded homogeneous inclusions in silicates or more commonly large interstitial grains exsolving pyrrhotite (Po), pentlandite (Pn) and chalcopyrite (Ccp), particularly when associated with Amp (**Fig_sulfides**). Rare platinum-group minerals (PGM) have been found, mainly Pt– Pd-rich tellurides, bismuthides and arsenides, hosted as needles in sulfides ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1); see **Fig_PGM**).

#### Dunites & chromitites

In the *Herbeira* massif, dunites outcrop alternately with pyroxenites and chromitites or as massive outcrops (**Fig_chromitites**). It is the most common lithology above (_i.e._ upper dunite of [Moreno _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601)), and to a lesser extent, below (_i.e._ lower dunite) the pyroxenite-rich area (see **Fig_map-herbeira**). Transition to the pyroxenite-rich area is gradational, showing a downward and upward decrease in the frequency of distinctively weathering pyroxenite layers. In massive dunite outcrops, thin, partially "dissolved" pyroxenite layers suggest that a generation of pyroxenites pre-dates dunitization (**Fig_dissolved-pyroxenite**). Dunite occurs less commonly as decameter-size pods with diffuse contacts within harzburgites ([Santos _et al._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/43.1.17)), notably associated with chromitites at the beach level in the *Herbeira* cliffs ([Moreno _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601)).

**Fig_dissolved-pyroxenite**. Chromite precipitated _via_ incongruent melting or dissolution of pyroxenes at the termination of a pre-existing pyroxenite layer in the lower dunite near *Punta Robaliceira* ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)).

Despite being foliated, Cabo Ortegal dunites are less deformed and serpentinized than the harzburgites. Both the upper and lower dunites exhibit serpentinized mm-size Ol porphyroclasts and small neoblasts. Sporadic Opx and large (> 3 mm) Cpx grains occur interstitially, as well as Amp, Chl and locally phlogopite (Phl). A variety of accessory minerals has been reported ([Monterrubio Pérez, 1991](https://docta.ucm.es/entities/publication/fda0fa77-a464-4c62-a271-a50d4da99ba3); Monterrubio Pérez _et al._, 1992), including Mag, Pn, Ccp, Po and heazlewoodite (Hzl). 

Chromian Spl occurs as elongated grains outlining the foliation. In the lower dunite, it is restricted to disseminated grains and rare, thin chromitite layers. In the upper dunite, it is much more abundant and occurs concentrated in pods, lenses or layers > 10-cm thick (Monterrubio Pérez _et al._, 1992) and irregular concentrations (schlieren) up to 50-cm thick (Moreno 1999, [Moreno _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601)).

Chromitite occurences in the upper dunite have been classified as follows ([Garcia-Tudela _et al._, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2024.106109)):

- **Type-I**. Massive (> 80 % Chr) chromitites with coarse (>500 μm) Chr grains;
- **Type-II**. Semi-massive (< 80 % Chr) chromitites with smaller and more altered modular Chr grains and pull-apart texture.

In chromitites, Chr grains occur in a matrix of serpentine (Srp) and Chl. They may exhibit thin Fe-rich alteration rims and inclusions of Cpx, Amp, sulfides (mainly Pn and Ccp) and PGM (near grain boundaries in type II), as well as Chl and locally Ap in type-I and Ol in type-II chromitites. Detailed study of the PGM revealed a remarkably diversity of primary and secondary platinum-group sulphides, alloys, arsenides and other minerals (Moreno _et al._, 1999, [Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1), [Garcia-Tudela _et al._, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2024.106109); **Fig_chromitites-PGM**)

#### Other rocks

Mafic rocks occur as a 3–5 m thick outcrop near the top of the pyroxenite-rich domain, parallel to the main foliation (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991). It exhibits 5-20-cm granoblastic layers of Grt, Zo and minor Cpx, alternating with layers rich in Amp ± Zo or Spl. Kyanite (Ky) inclusions in Zo and Spl and corundum (Crn) inclusions in Grt have been reported ([Santos _et al._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/43.1.17)). K-feldspar (Kfs) and plagioclase (Plg) are rare accessory minerals. A gradual transition is observed between these rocks and Grt clinopyroxenite with Rt partly replaced by titanite (Ttn) and minor Ilm. These lithologies originally described as a gabbroic facies by Girardeau _et al._, (1989) are most likely unrelated to the main pyroxenites (see **Section 3.2**). 

Other lithologies include pyroxenite and Grt-rich dykes injected in C’-like tensional fractures (Girardeau _et al._, 1990, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991), which commonly occur cross-cutting the compositional layering at a high angle (>30°) in the pyroxenite-rich domain (**Fig_pyroxenite-dykes**). These dykes are only deformed in mylonitic bands near the contacts with underlying granulites (see **Stop 1.7**), sealed in turn by undeformed pyroxenite dykes injected in Riedel fractures (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991), particularly abundant in the upper dunite.

### 3.2 Protolith interpretations

#### Brief historical review

*1960-70s: lherzolitic mantle diapirs*

The Cabo Ortegal Complex was originally studied by a group of Dutch researchers who published a series of comprehensive articles describing the geology and petrology of the different units ([Vogel, 1967](https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/505641), [Masskant, 1970](https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/505696), Engels, 1972, Den Tex _et al._, 1972), mostly published in the journal edited by Leiden University *Leidse Geologische Mededelinge*. This group also published the earliest geochemical and isotopic studies of the complex (Van Calsteren, 1978, 1979), including data obtained from a 150-m drilled core (one of the six boreholes drilled in the *Herbeira* massif by *Chartered Exploraciones*). The multiphase tectonothermal history of the HP-HT units was recognized early on as a significant impediment to understanding the origin of the ultramafic massifs:

*« Speculations about the origin of the ultrabasites are doomed to be fruitless in view of the various geological processes to which these rocks have been subjected. »* ([Vogel, 1967](https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/505641))

The protoliths of Cabo Ortegal peridotites were first inferred to be a lherzolite where Cpx has been replaced by hornblende ([Masskant, 1970](https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/505696)). Their emplacement was ascribed to one or several diapirs segregated from a mantle plume either along an oceanic geotherm (Maaskant 1970) or into the continental crust, thus responsible for granulites-facies metamorphism of originally eclogitic lower crust (Van Calsteren _et al._, 1977). The different pyroxenites were regarded as _in-situ_ partial melting products of the lherzolite.

*1980-90s: heterogeneity of the upper mantle.*

More work was carried out in the 1980s and 1990s by Spanish and French collaborations (Arenas _et al._, 1986; Bernard-Griffiths et al, 1985; Gil Ibarguchi _et al._, 1990, Peucat _et al._, 1990), notably focusing on the ultramafic massifs (_e.g._, Girardeau _et al._, 1989; Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi 1991), as part of two PhD theses (Ben Jamaa, 1988, Laribi-Halimi, 1992). Other PhD theses include that of [Gravestock (1992)](https://oro.open.ac.uk/65312/), who studied the geochemistry of the pyroxenites, re-investigating the drilled core studied by Van Calsteren and co-workers, as well as the granulites and eclogites.

From then on, the peridotite protoliths were considered as a Spl-harzburgite (ascribing part of the amphibolitization to near-isochemical retrograde hydration). They were interpreted as a residual oceanic mantle owing to its depleted mineral chemistry (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, Laribi-Halimi, 1992), potentially representing imbricated tectonic slices of a subducted slab (Gil Ibarguchi _et al._, 1990). However, relatively low ε<sub>Nd</sub> (~ +4) measured in a harzburgite compared to the N-MORB-like eclogites with ε<sub>Nd</sub> (~ +10) and the occurrence of hundreds of meters of pyroxenite were problematic in such an oceanic setting (Ben Jamaa, 1988). A sub-continental influence and back-arc setting were thus envisaged (Peucat _et al._, 1990). In this context, the intrusion of external melts reacting with the ambient peridotite was recognized as a more reasonable scenario to explain the observed amount of pyroxenites (Girardeau _et al._, 1989, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, [Gravestock, 1992](https://oro.open.ac.uk/65312/)).

*2000s: lower-crustal arc-root cumulate* 

Following the work of [Monterrubio Pérez (1991)](https://docta.ucm.es/entities/publication/fda0fa77-a464-4c62-a271-a50d4da99ba3), who included the *Herbeira* massif as part of his broader study on mineralization in ultramafic rocks of the Variscan belt of Spain, Moreno (1999) focussed her PhD on the *Herbeira* chromitites. The layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association exposed in the cliffs was interpreted as the magmatic stratigraphy of a lower-crustal cumulate in an arc root ([Moreno _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601)), based on increasing platinum-group element (PGE) contents (_i.e._ from the PGE-poor lower dunite to the PGE-rich upper dunite) and progressive PGE fractionation towards Pd-Pt enrichment (**Fig_PGE**) in the chromitites.

**Fig_PGE**. **a.** Sketch depicting the stratigraphic interpretation of the W part of the *Herbeira* massif as a lower-crustal cumulate sequence based on increasing PGE enrichment and fractionation ([Moreno _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601)). Representative PGE distributions (chondrite-normalized) are shown along with the highest concentration obtained at each location. **b.** Map showing the corresponding chromitite sample locations; note the location of the suggested Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF; see **Stop 1.7**). Location 2 corresponds to chromitite-bearing dunite pods in harzburgite ([Moreno _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601)).

This arc-related interpretation provides a better explanation to the residual character of the harzburgites which was confirmed by [Santos _et al._ (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/43.1.17) based on mantle-array-like Ol chemistry (_i.e._ ~ 0.4 % NiO, Fo90). These authors also identified a fractional crystallization trend of decreasing NiO and Fo in Ol between the pyroxenites and dunites (see **fig_mineral-chemistry-olivine**). Overall, they considered the lithological heterogeneity of the *Herbeira* massif as derived from a mantle wedge modified by slab-derived fluids or melts.

In this context, the subordinate Grt-rich mafic rocks, relatively Al- and Ti-rich, are clearly unrelated to the main pyroxenites (**Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**). They also exhibit positive Eu, Sr and Ba anomalies and high alkali contents suggesting the former presence of Plg ([Santos _et al._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/43.1.17)).

#### Petrogenetic model of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites

Following on the original work by Girardeau and coworkers, the ultramafic massifs were recently re-investigated as part of two PhD theses ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1), Henry 2018). A more comprehensive petrogenetic model combining magmatic differentiation and melt-peridotite interaction (**Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**) was formulated based on the classification of the pyroxenite subtypes and new geochemical data ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064), [2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1), [2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105346)). In this classification, the strongly foliated and amphibolitized (type-3) pyroxenites are ascribed to deformational, metamorphic and metasomatic overprints. Accordingly, their petrogenesis is specifically discussed as part of the tectonothermal evolution of the massifs (**Section 5**) and in the description of **Stop 1.3**.

The Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites have markedly higher SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaO, Cr and Sc contents and lower Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub> and Ni contents than pyroxenites from most ultramafic massifs (_e.g._, Horoman, Ronda, Beni Boussera, Lanzo, Lherz). High concentrations of compatible elements (_e.g._, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> > 0.4%) and low-Al pyroxenes suggest that they crystallized from primitive, low Al/Si parental melts. The petrogenetic model proposed by [Tilhac (2017)](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1) specifically invokes the intrusion into a lithospheric arc root of a primitive Si-undersaturated melt, interacting with the host harzburgites to produce dunites and chromitites, as well as Ol-bearing, Cpx-rich pyroxenites (type 1), which represent incomplete replacement products of the peridotites (**Fig-petrogenetic_model**). Massive Ol-free websterites (type 2) either represent more differentiated products of this process and/or cumulates of a distinct, Si-saturated melt ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)).

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/petrogenetic-model.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig-petrogenetic-model**. Schematic representation of the model proposed by [Tilhac (2017)](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1) for the main magmatic episode in the petrogenesis of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites, dunites and chromitites, assuming an initially Si-undersaturated (**a**) and/or Si-saturated (**b**) melt. Note that the spatial association of chromitites and type-4 pyroxenites had not been identified by [Tilhac (2017)](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1) and are thus not well reflected. Some aspects depicted in this model are here refined in a two-stage model (picritic then boninitic). "Dissolved" pyroxenite layers (**Fig-dissolved-pyroxenite**) interpreted as an older generation may rather correspond to type-1 pyroxenites affected by stage-2 dunitization, depending on the extent of Ol fractionation of the more Si-rich, stage-2 melt ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064))

In this model, whether type-1 and type-2 pyroxenites are cogenetic was left as an open question and two scenarios involving different parental melts were proposed for type-2 pyroxenites:
- Evidence in favour of their cogeneticity (**Fig_petrogenetic-model_a**) includes relatively homogeneous radiogenic isotope compositions consistent with a single batch of parental melt (_e.g_, [Gravestock, 1992](https://oro.open.ac.uk/65312/); [Santos _et al._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/43.1.17); [Tilhac _et al._, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.07.017)). Mineral chemistry also suggests that the pyroxenites can mostly be related to the same melt differentation/melt-rock interaction trend (_e.g._, **Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites_b**). However, the high Mg# and Cr# of the Opx-rich (type-4) pyroxenites is problematic in this case.
- Evidence against their cogeneticity (**Fig_petrogenetic-model_b**) consists of field observations on large outcrop surfaces exposed on the shore at the bottom of the *Herbeira* cliffs. Massive (type-2) pyroxenites are seen as thick and layers, relatively undeformed compared to type-1 and type-3 pyroxenites (**Fig-pyroxenites-cliff**), which cannot be fully accounted for by deformation localization away from thick pyroxenite layers. In addition, the high Mg# and Cr# of type-4 pyroxenites and their association with chromitites point to a very primitive character, suggesting that they are more likely to be related to type-2 pyroxenites (see **Stop 1.4**).

Outcrop on the shoreline at the bottom of the *Herbeira* cliffs exposing field relationships between different types of pyroxenites ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)).

Based on the considerations above, the latter scenario (two subsequent melt intrusions) is here preferred and summarized below:
1. A Si-undersaturated melt such (_e.g._, ultra-calcic picrite) led to the formation of dunites and branching veins of replacive Ol clinopyroxenites (type 1) preserving dunite lenses (see **Stop 1.2**). Some websterites locally formed at higher melt/rock ratios. 
2. A more Si-rich melt (_e.g._, boninite) led to the formation of primitive orthopyroxenites (type-4) and the more evolved, massive websterites (see **Stop 1.2** & **1.3**)

**Fig_mineral-chemistry-cpx**. Covariation diagram of Cpx in type-1 pyroxenites (**a**) and type-2 and -4 pyroxenites (**b**), corresponding to stage-1 melt-peridotite interaction and stage-2 differentation trends, respectively. Note that both trends are relatively Al-poor compared to the Grt-rich mafic rocks, and to a lesser extent, some of peridotites. 

Note type-3 pyroxenites overlaping the range of Mg# at lower Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, interpreted as the result of subsolidus re-requilibration with higher proportions of Amp.

In this scenario, chromitites are most likely associated with the boninitic stage 2 following a crystallization sequence of Ol + Cr-Spl > Opx > Cpx expected for instance for low-Ca boninite (Crawford _et al._, 1989). Type-4 pyroxenites are indeed mostly observed near chromitites. However, it cannot be excluded that chromitites also formed during stage 1. 

This petrogenetic model is compatible with the conclusion from [Moreno _et al._, (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601) that the chromitites crystallized from a S-poor, mantle-derived melt. Indeed, the abundance of sulfides (up 1 %) cannot be accounted for by the low S contents of boninitic or picritic melts. Accordingly, a secondary S addition is suggested by the textural association between interstitial sulfides and Amp ([Tilhac _et al._, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105346)). The two-stage scenario described above could also be consistent with the interpretations of [Garcia-Tudela _et al._ (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2024.106109) invoking two distinct parental melts (_i.e._ a fore-arc basalt and a boninite) for the chromitites. However, the latter relies on the questionable assumption that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> contents in Chr are not affected by subsolidus re-requilibration. This aspect is further discussed in **Stop 1.6**. 

### 3.3 Thermobarometric estimates

The occurrence of Grt as relatively undeformed coronas around Spl in the main pyroxenites is indicative of syn- to post-kinematic prograde metamorphism. Peak conditions under eclogite-facies conditions have been calculated at 1.6-1.8 GPa and 780-800 °C (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, [Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)). Similar conditions are recorded by the late pyroxenite and Grt-rich dykes (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991) which were probably intruded near peak conditions.

Amphibolitization of the peridotites and pyroxenites suggests an episode of retrograde metamorphism (and hydration). Corresponding P-T conditions have not been calculated in the ultramafic massifs, but probably correspond to amphibolite-facies conditions (~ 0.8 GPa, 500 °C; Abalos _et al._, 2003) documented in other HP-HT units of the complex, although unpublished calculations based on Amp compositions yield lower pressure (~0.4 GPa).

### 3.4 Age constraints

As in the other HP-HT units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex, two main age clusters have been identified in the ultramafic massifs. 

#### Middle Devonian age cluster

A first cluster at ~ 390 Ma is particularly well documented by zircon (Zrn) and rutile (Rt) U-Pb ages of 383-392 Ma, notably in a Grt clinopyroxenite vein in the *Uzal* massif (Peucat _et al._, 1990, Santos Zalduegui _et al._, 1996, Ordóñez Casado _et al._, 2001). It overlaps with WR Rb-Sr and K-Ar ages of 386-401 Ma obtained for the *Herbeira* peridotites (Van Calsteren _et al._, 1979, Kuijper _et al._, 1982) and a U-Pb isochron age of 400 ± 26 Ma reported for the peridotites, pyroxenites and Grt-bearing mafic rocks. The latter also yielded Sm-Nd isochron ages of 392-394 Ma ([Santos _et al._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/43.1.17)).

This cluster is coeval with the HP-HT metamorphic event documented by U-Pb and <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar ages of 382-395 Ma in the adjacent HP-HT units (Santos Zalduegui _et al._, 1996, Ordóñez Casado _et al._, 2001, Gómez Barreiro _et al._, 2007), associated with a well documented Devonian subduction. In the ultramafic massifs, it also dates the peak of HP metamorphism as well as the formation of cross-cutting pyroxenite veins and other intrusive bodies. Among them, a pegmatitic granite intruded into the *Uzal* peridotite provide a minimum age for the ultramafic massifs at 387-388 Ma (Santos Zalduegui _et al._, 1996)

#### Cambro-Ordovician age cluster

A second age cluster at ~ 500 Ma was first recognized by Rb-Sr ages of 477 ± 122 Ma for the *Herbeira* peridotites (Van Calsteren _et al._, 1979) and Sm-Nd ages of 493-506 Ma for the pyroxenites ([Santos _et al._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/43.1.17)). It was recently confirmed by Sm–Nd ages of 459–515 Ma ([Tilhac _et al._, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.07.017)), including an external isochron at 474 ± 59 Ma defined by the variously LREE-enriched pyroxenite subtypes (see **Stops 2** and **3**). The latter remarkably coincides with an isochron age of 459 ± 84 Ma calculated for an increasingly LREE-enriched sample (CO-010; **Fig_CO-010**), whose enrichment probably relates to the percolation of residual websteritic melts, as discussed in **Section 3.2**. 

This cluster is comparable to U-Pb zircon ages of 480-520 Ma reported in other HP-HT units and interpreted as related to the formation of most of the granulites and eclogite protoliths in a Cambrian oceanic domain and Ordovocian arc, respectively (Peucat _et al._, 1990, Ordóñez Casado _et al._, 1996, 2001). Tilhac _et al._, (2017) interpreted these ages in the ultramafic as representing minimum estimates, owing to the potential partial reset of the Sm-Nd system associated with amphibolitization. Second-stage Nd model ages of 502–762 Ma indeed suggest that some of Cabo Ortegal peridotites and pyroxenites could be older than 500 Ma ([Tilhac _et al._, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.07.017)). This is consistent with the Re-depletion model age (τ<sub>RD</sub>) of 588 Ma obtained for a harzburgite. A Re-Os isochron age at 838 ± 42 Ma was also obtained from the samples most preserved from Re addition associated with amphibolitization and supergene alteration ([Tilhac _et al._, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105346)), which preferentially affected low-Mg#, low-Cu/S pyroxenites.

## 4. Other HP-HT units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex

### 4.1 Granulites

#### Field aspect & petrography

The granulites of the Cabo Ortegal Complex occur in three distinct areas: the *Bacariza* formation* (to the E), which is the largest and best-preserved, and the *Monte Agüdo* (to the S) and *Candelaria* (to the W) amphibolites, which are characterized by a higher Amp contents (**Fig. 4.1**). 

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/map-granulites.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig. 4.1**. Map of the Upper Tectonic unit of the Cabo Ortegal Complex showing the location of the HP granulites (*Bacariza* formation) and the amphibolitized HP granulites of *Candelaria* and *Monte Agüdo*.

The *Bacariza* granulites outcrop between the *Concepenido* eclogites to the E and the ultramafic massifs to the W (see **Fig_hp-ht-units**). Both amphibolite formations are in contact with the HP paragneisses, and the *Candelaria* amphibolites are additionally in tectonic contact with other non-HP-HT units along the *Carreiro* shear zone to the W.

The contacts between the granulites and the ultramafic massifs have been interpreted in different ways: some authors describe them as ductile thrusts ([Ábalos _et al._, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1029/2002TC001405); [Puelles _et al._, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2005.01.009)), while others propose non-tectonic lithological conformities that could represent a crust-mantle transition ([Galán & Marcos, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1007/s005310050162), [2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0024-4937(00)00020-7); [Marcos _et al._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1130/0-8137-2364-7.143)). 

The Cabo Ortegal granulites are characterized by two main features:

- **Lack of Opx and high Grt contents**: This is typical of HP granulites. They display highly variable contents of Cpx, Amp and Plg, defining them as Opx-free Grt granulites.

- **Wide compositional range**: The granulites show significant compositional variation, ranging from ultramafic to acidic compositions (**Fig. 4.2**).

Unpublished data from the OUTCROP project (M.A. Lopez-Sanchez; [SV-PA-21-AYUD/2021/57163](https://marcoalopez.github.io/OUTCROPproject/)).

Additionally, Cabo Ortegal granulitic formations contain Si-poor rocks Fe-Ti-rich rocks primarily composed of Cpx, Grt, and pargasitic Amp in variable proportions (**Fig. 4.3**). In the *Bacariza* formation, these Fe-Ti-rich rocks form a continuous layer along the contact with the *Uzal* peridotite massif to the W and the Opx-free granulites to the E (**Fig_hp-ht-units**). In *Monte Agüdo*, they are enclosed in Opx-free, Amp-rich granulites and bound by a tectonic contact to the S, leaving their overlying unit unobserved. These Si-poor Fe-Ti-rich rocks also occur in all three formations as elongated lenses parallel to the tectonic foliation embedded in the granulitic matrix  (see **Fig. 4.3c**).

This excursion includes the **Bacariza granulites**, which are the best-preserved examples within the Cabo Ortegal Complex. Apart from some volumetrically minor and exotic types, such as leptynitic gneisses, calcite-rich granulites (Fig. 4.3e), and Mg-rich granulites ([Galán and Marcos, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0024-4937(00)00020-7); Puelles, 2004), the Bacariza granulites can be grouped into five primary types based on their silica content, ranging from ultramafic to acidic compositions:

- **Si-poor (ultramafic to mafic) Fe-Ti-rich rocks**. These coarse- to medium-grained rocks are bi- or tri-mineralic, consisting primarily of Grt-Cpx-Prg, with Pl+Qtz content < 5 %. They range from dominant pyrigarnites ([Vogel, 1967](https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/505641)), composed mainly of Cpx-Grt, to pyribolites (Cpx-Amp) or horblendites (Amp) with all grades in between (**Fig. 4.3a** & **d**).

- **Grt-rich mafic granulites**. This is the dominant granulite facies in Cabo Ortegal, often referred to as layered granulites, owing to the contrasting appearance of mafic and Plg-rich layers. These rocks are coarse- to medium-grained, with Amp content > 5 %. Clinopyroxene ranges from augite to omphacite, and Amp from pargasite to pargasitic hornblende (**Fig. 4.3b**).

- **Grt-rich amphibolites**. These are also coarse- to medium-grained layered granulites, but almost Cpx-free (**Fig. 4.3c**). They are intermediate rocks and occasionally exhibit evidence of partial melting.

- **Grt-bearing trondhjemitic gneisses**. These acidic rocks are volumetrically less abundant but not rare. They are observed crystallised _in situ_ or as cross-cutting cm-thick veins (**Fig. 4.3d**).

- **High-pressure migmatitic gneisses**. Also referred to as granulitic orthogneiss, these rocks range from mafic to acidic compositions and outcrop between the *Limo* and *Herbeira* peridotitic massifs(**Fig_map-cabo-ortegal**).

#### Protolith interpretations

Various origins have been proposed for these rocks, including: (1) residues of deep anatexis (Drury, 1980), (2) upper crust of a volcanic arc near a continental margin or continental tholeiites ([Peucat _et al._, 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/0040-1951(90)90285-G)), (3) crystal fractionation from melts derived from a primitive mantle source ([Gravestock, 1992](https://oro.open.ac.uk/65312/)), or (4) a stratiform gabbroic complex at the base of the continental crust ([Galán and Marcos, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1007/s005310050162)). Although no consensus exists, all the above interpretations suggest a sub-continental or arc-related tectonic environment.

#### Thermobarometric estimates

Maximum pressures in the high-pressure migmatites have been established between 1.9-2.3 GPa at temperatures of 815-865 °C ([Beranoaguirre _et al._, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2020.105660)). These pressures are comparable to those reached in the *Concepenido* eclogites, but at relatively higher temperatures. Peak conditions for mafic granulites range between 1.6-2.0 GPa and 740-950 °C, depending on the method used ([Gil Ibarguchi _et al._, 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/0024-4937(90)90011-O); [Galán and Marcos, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0024-4937(00)00020-7); [Puelles _et al._, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2005.01.009); [Spránitz _et al._, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1111/jmg.12666)). Pyrigarnites yielded peak conditions of 1.7 GPa and 800°C (Gil Ibarguchi _et al._, 1991).

#### Age constraints

U-Pb geochronology (zircon, titanite, rutile) yields two distinct age clusters. The first cluster at 372-392 Ma is interpreted as the peak of HP metamorphism and associated partial melting during a subduction event ([Santos Zalduegui _et al._, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(95)00144-1); [Fernández-Suárez _et al._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00410-001-0337-2); [Beranoaguirre _et al._, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2020.105660)). The second cluster at 459-497 Ma is interpreted by most authors as the age of the magmatic protolith, although it may also represent an earlier metamorphic event ([Fernández-Suárez _et al._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00410-001-0337-2); [Beranoaguirre _et al._, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2020.105660)).

### 4.2 Eclogites 

#### Field aspect & petrography 

The Cabo Ortegal eclogites form a continuous band approximately 20-km long, known as the *Concepenido* formation, which is among the longest eclogite outcrops in the world (Ábalos, 1997). The formation thickness vary from 100 to 700 m. It is sandwiched between Opx-free Grt granulites to the W and HP paragneises to the E, with which they are partly associated (**Fig_map-eclogites**).

**Fig_map-eclogites_**. Map of the Upper Tectonic unit of the Cabo Ortegal Complex showing the location of the *Concepenido* eclogites. Note the Ky-bearing eclogites occuring within the main eclogite body.

Fresh eclogite samples typically consist of 40-55 % Cpx, 25-35 % Grt, 2-10 % Qtz, ≤ 10 % Zo, 4-7 % Amp, 1-3 % Rt and ≤ 1 % Phl (Mendia 1996). Locally, Grt can dominate (up to 85 %) in centimetric bands. However, most eclogites are Zo-Amp eclogites. Eclogites also show local evidence of partial melting. Three types are distinguished (Mendia, 1996):

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/eclogites2.jpg"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Figure 4.4**. Hand samples of Cabo Ortegal eclogites. **Top**: Appearance of common eclogites on fresh (**right**) and altered (**left**) surfaces. **Bottom**: Appearance of Ky-bearing eclogites on fresh (**left**) and altered (**right**) surfaces.

- **Common eclogites** (_i.e._ volumetrically dominant ~ 70 %): These range from massive, lacking lineation and exhibiting a weak foliation, to strongly deformed mylonitic LS-tectonites. Garnet typically ranges in size from 1 to 3 mm, but can exceptionally exceed 2 cm (**Fig. 4.4**). They exhibit very homogeneous N-MORB-like major and trace-element compositions (**Fig. 4.5**).

- **Ky-bearing eclogites**: These eclogites are strongly deformed and systematically contain Ky. They appear lighter in color compared to common eclogites and contain larger Grt and Cpx, ranging from several mm up to 6 cm (**Fig. 4.4**). These rocks are enriched in Al and Mg compared to the common eclogites.
  
- **Ferro-titaniferous eclogites**: Representing less than 5 % of the total volume, these eclogites are richer in Fe and Ti. Although they appear similar to common eclogites, they contain more Rt and their minerals are more ferrous.

**Figure 4.5**. Total Alkali-Silica (TAS) diagram for the common *Concepenido* eclogites (**left**) and Ky-bearing eclogites and eclogitic lenses within adjacent HP gneisses (**right**). The common eclogites display highly homogeneous basaltic compositions, while the Ky-bearing eclogites show greater compositional variability.Unpublished data from the OUTCROP project (M.A. Lopez-Sanchez; [SV-PA-21-AYUD/2021/57163](https://marcoalopez.github.io/OUTCROPproject/)).

The eclogites display tight, km-scale folds that are inferred from geological mapping and are, in some cases visible at the scale of hundreds of meters (see **Stop 2.5**).

#### Protolith interpretations

The common eclogites are interpreted as a metamorphosed piece of N-MORB-like diabasic dikes and gabbros derived from the oceanic crust ([Bernard-Griffiths _et al._, 1985](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-9622(85)90019-3)), though significant continental contamination has been suggested ([Gravestock, 1992](https://oro.open.ac.uk/65312/)). The Ky-bearing eclogites are interpreted as Plg-rich troctolitic cumulates  (Gil Ibarguchi _et al._, 1991), while ferro-titaniferous eclogites are interpreted as differentiated products of a tholeiitic series (Mendia, 2000).

#### Thermobarometric estimates

Peak metamorphic conditions for both common and Ky-bearing eclogites correspond to ~ 1.7-2.3 GPa and 770-800 °C (Mendia, 2000; [Mendia _et al._, 2001](http://hdl.handle.net/2183/6534)). Retrograde metamorphism is recorded by amphibolitization and the appearance of Plg at ~ 600 °C and 1.2-1.6 GPa (Mendia, 2000).

#### Age constraints

Zircon U-Pb dating shows an age cluster around 390 Ma (middle Devonian), interpreted as the timing of eclogitization ([Ordóñez Casado _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0040-1951(00)00210-9)). Older ages of 470-495 Ma (late Cambrian to early Ordovician) ([Bernard-Griffiths _et al._, 1985](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-9622(85)90019-3); [Peucat _et al._, 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/0040-1951(90)90285-G); Schäfer _et al._, 1993; [Ordóñez Casado _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0040-1951(00)00210-9)) are ascribed to the formation age of the mafic protoliths for both common and Ky-bearing eclogites.

### 4.3 High-pressure gneisses

#### Field aspect & petrography

High-pressure gneisses occur as two mappable formations: the *Banded* and the *Chímparra* gneisses (**Fig_map-hp-gneisses**). Although some geological maps treat them as distinct units, they share many similarities and are here considered together. Both are characterized by highly deformed Grt- and Ky-bearing quartzo-feldspathic gneisses, including lenses of retrogressed eclogites, Grt pyroxenites, and granulites. These formations display strong deformation features and evidence of partial melting. The main distinction is that the *Banded gneiss* also contains tonalitic orthogneisses and occasional coronitic metagabbros.

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/map-hp-gneisses.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_map-hp-gneisses**. Map of the Upper Tectonic unit of the Cabo Ortegal Complex showing the location of the HP gneiss formations. Note that some authors interpret parts of the E gneiss body (_i.e._ *Cariño* gneiss formation) as a separate intermediate pressure (IP) unit (_e.g._ Albert 2012) separated from the *Banded* gneiss by an extensional fault (REF, Arenas) or a normal contact (REF Puelles). Others (_e.g._, Fernández _et al._, 2016) do not distinguish these units and simply consider a strong metamorphic and deformational gradient (1.2 GPa and 700 ºC in the *Cariño* gneiss is _vs_ 1.5-1.7 GPa and 800-900 ºC in the rest of the *Banded* gneiss). 

#### Protolith interpretations

The *Chímparra* gneisses are thought to derive from pelitic and semi-pelitic (graywacke-like) sediments with minor calc-silicate and mafic inclusions (Fernández, 1994). In contrast, the *Banded gneisses* are interpreted as a shallow crustal volcano-sedimentary sequence (Albert, 2017), punctuated by mafic intrusions (now eclogites) and lesser granitic and tonalitic bodies (now orthogneisses) 

#### Thermobarometric estimates

The *Chímparra* gneiss reached peak metamorphic conditions of 1.5-1.7 GPa and 800-900 °C (Fernández, 1994; Fernández and Marcos, 1997).

#### Age constraints

Zircon provenance studies indicate that the sediments forming these gneisses are younger than 515 ± 15 Ma ([Ordóñez Casado _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0040-1951(00)00210-9); [Albert _et al._, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1111/jmg.12155); Albert, 2017). Felsic dykes hosted in the *Banded* gneiss have yielded Zrn and Mnz U-Pb ages of 475-485 Ma (early Ordovician), interpreted as the age of their intrusion into the sediments ([Fernández _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.5194/se-7-579-2016)). Accordingly, the paragneisses represent middle- to late-Cambrian sediments. On the other hand, U-Pb ages on Zrc, Mnz and Rt in leucosomes dated the migmatisation at 382-394 Ma (middle Devonian), matching the U-Pb Zrc ages from the eclogite lenses (390-393 Ma) and orthogneisses (395 Ma) within the *Banded* gneiss ([Valverde Vaquero and Fernández 1996](https://hdl.handle.net/10651/73974); [Fernández _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.5194/se-7-579-2016); Albert, 2017).

## 5 Tectonic summary
 
We attempt below to provide a brief summary of the origin and evolution of the ultramafic massifs that takes into account field observations, tectono-thermal and geochronological constraints from the different HP-HT units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex.

### 5.1 Magmatic history: a peri-Gondwanan volcanic arc

Many lines of evidence indicate that the ultramafic massifs record magmatic activity in a subduction-related environment. The layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association of the *Herbeira* massif is ascribed to primitive picritic and boninitic melt intrusions into lithospheric root of a volcanic arc ([Moreno _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601), [Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)). High CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, low TiO<sub>2</sub> and alkalis in the pyroxenites more specifically indicate a low Cpx/Opx (_i.e._ harzburgitic) mantle, metasomatized by slab- or mantle-wedge derived hydrous fluids, silicate melts ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)) or carbonatites ([Gravestock, 1992](https://oro.open.ac.uk/65312/)), in good agreement with the characteristic enrichment of the LREE and large ion lithophile (LILE) enrichment over depleted high field strength elements (HFSE).

Accordingly, a continental volcanic arc setting was suggested for the granulite protoliths (Peucat _et al._, 1990) and the occurrence of ultramafic cumulates comparable to arclogites is also compatible with this interpretation. Such a lithological sequence (****Fig_hacker-diagram**) is indeed observed in the deep sections of young and modern arc (Ducea _et al._, 2021, and references therein).

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/hacker-diagram.png"
style="max-width: 75%; max-height:1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_hacker-diagram**. Hacker diagram of the different HP-HT units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex. The observed compositional trends are comparable to the volcanic (negative correlation between MgO and SiO<sub>2</sub>) and plutonic (positive correlation) trends reported in recent and modern volcanic arcs (_e.g._ Sierra Nevada).

In the nearby Bragança Complex in Portugal, a similar sub-arc environment was proposed for the origin of the chromitite-dunite association, interpreted as a product of partial melt extraction in the shallow mantle (Bridges _et al._, 1995). Many lithological features of the *Herbeira* massif are also similar to the Jijal ultramafic section of the famous Kohistan arc complex in Pakistan, where pyroxenites preserving dunite lenses are similarly interpreted as partial replacement of peridotite (Burg _et al._, 1998; Garrido _et al._, 2007). Accordingly, the chromitites from Cabo Ortegal and Bragança compositionally overlap those of the Jijal ([Moreno _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601)).

In this model, the nature and location of the crust-mantle transition remains unclear. Two main alternatives can be envisaged: 

- According to [Moreno _et al._, (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601), it is located at the base of the layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association (_i.e._ bottom of the *Herbeira* cliffs), which is assumed to be in tectonic contact against the E (harzburgitic) part of the Herbeira massif.
  
- According to Brown _et al._, (2009) and Llana-Fúnez _et al._, Brown _et al._, (2012), it is represented by the E contacts of the ultramafic massifs and the granulites. 

The former interpretation is conditioned to the questionable tectonic significance of the Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF), as discussed in detail in **Stop 1.7**. In contrast, the latter alternative is consistent with the formation of the layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association within the mantle (Girardeau _et al._, 1989, Gravestock 1992, [Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)).

Regionally, such a magmatic history fits with the activity of Cambro-Ordovician (at _ca._ 500 Ma) to Neoproterozoic arc (**Fig_geodynamics**), potentially corresponding to the incipient stage of a Cadomian arc built on a rifted margin of Gondwana ([Tilhac _et al._, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.07.017)), as previously invoked in NW (Andonaegui _et al._, 2016) and SW Iberia (_e.g._, Rojo-Pérez _et al._, 2024, Novo-Fernandez _et al._, 2024). Arc magmatism on the Gondwanan margin facing the Tornquist (or possibly the Iapetus) Ocean is further supported by detrital zircons derived from the West African which yielded prominent age peaks at around 2.1 and 2.7 Ga (Santos Zalduegui _et al._, 1995, Albert _et al._, 2015, Roper 2016). In the Iberian Autochthon, thick sedimentary sequences due to high rates of subsidence and the voluminous volcanics of the *Ollo de Sapo* formation record early-Ordovician extension interpreted as continental rifting during the separation of the arc from the Gondwanan margin (Martinez Catalan _et al._, 2019, and references therein).

**Fig_geodynamics**. Interpretative tectonic evolution of NW Iberia (Martínez Catalan _et al._, 2019, modified from Martínez Catalan _et al._, 2009 and references therein). The peri-Gondwanan arc inferred for the origin of the ultramafic massifs is shown in **a**.

In the Cabo Ortegal Complex, reworking of the Gondwanan margin during arc magmatism is compatible with radiogenic isotope compositions of the pyroxenites (and granulites). This data include decoupled Hf-Nd with ε<sub>Hf</sub> exceeding + 100, corresponding to Paleoproterozoic to Archean Hf model ages ([Tilhac _et al._, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105346)), as well as moderately enriched (_i.e._ EM1) Pb, Sr and Nd isotopes (Gravestock 1992, Santos _et al._, 2002, [Tilhac _et al._, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.07.017)).

### 5.2 Prograde tectonothermal evolution: the Devonian subduction

All the HP-HT units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex record a deformation episode D<sub>1</sub> (Ábalos _et al._, 2003) ascribed to a Devonian subduction (**Fig_P-T-t-paths**). In the ultramafic massifs, it is recorded by a mylonitic foliation near tectonic contacts and sheath folds developed during thrusting of the massifs over the underlying granulites.

> NOTE: Add the HP-HT map summarizing peak conditions?

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/p-t-paths.png"

**Fig_P-T-t-paths**. P-T-t paths of the different HP-HT units showing geochronological and geothermobarometric constraints on protolith formation and deformation episodes D<sub>1</sub> to D<sub>4</sub>, with respect subduction, tectonic accretion, forced return flow (syn-subduction exhumation) in a subduction channel, and the subsequent exhumation during orogenic collision (Abalos _et al._, 2003).

Until recently, these folds depicting the style of deformation in deep subduction settings (Ábalos _et al._, 2003) had been recognized in all the units of the Upper Allochthon (Azcárraga _et al._, 2002), except in the *Limo* and *Herbeira* massifs. *Limo* was initially described as structurally homogeneous (Ben Jamaa, 1988, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, García Izquierdo _et al._, 2011) due to the strong alteration of most outcrops inland. However, good exposures of harzburgites were found in the NW cliffs revealing large-scale stacking of extremely elongated sheath folds (Puelles _et al._, 2012). Similar folds were then found affecting both peridotites and pyroxenites in the *Herbeira* massif ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064), [Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)), indicating that the massif underwent D<sub>1</sub> as an entity, and that formation of the main pyroxenites pre-date this deformation episode.

style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_sheath-folds**. Sheath folds affecting harzburgites near seal level at *Punta Robaliceira* (**a**) as well pyroxenites and dunites in the lower part of Herbeira cliffs **(b)**, as shown in the map of the *Herbeira* massif (**Fig_map-herbeira**). 

> NOTE: Add a zoomed in view and detail of the oriented Chl.

D<sub>1</sub> was coeval or rapidly followed by the peak of eclogite-facies metamorphism well documented in all the HP-HT units  (1.6-1.8 GPa for the pyroxenites and up to 2.2 GPa for the eclogites). In the ultramafic massifs, it corresponds to the appearance of Grt in massive websterites as well limited partial melting evidenced by rare cross-cutting pyroxenite veins (Peucat _et al._, 1990) and intrusive granite bodies (Santos _et al._, 1996).

In addition, the ultramafic massifs have experienced high-temperature shear deformation D<sub>HT</sub> (Ábalos _et al._, 2003) at > 1000 °C which pre-dates D<sub>1</sub> (**Fig_P-T-t-paths**). It is recorded by A-type (Jung & Karato, 2001) lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) in Ol, as evidenced by early petrofabric studies (Ben Jamaa, 1988, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, Girardeau _et al._, 1990) and confirmed by EBSD techniques applied to the *Limo* (Puelles _et al._, 2012) and *Herbeira* massifs (García-Izquierdo 2005, García-Izquierdo _et al._, 2011, Henry _et al._, 2017, Henry 2018). This deformation episode is responsible for a tectonic foliation parallel to the compositional layering as well isoclinal folding and boudinage, particularly outlined by pyroxenites (**Fig_HT-deformation**).

**Fig_HT-deformation**. Representative examples of HT deformation features ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)): typical boudinage of a pyroxenite layer in the *Herbeira* cliffs (**a**) and isoclinal fold outlined by a pyroxenite layer (**b**).
 
[Tilhac _et al._ (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064) suggested that the sequence of D<sub>HT</sub> (_i.e._ potentially asthenospheric deformation), followed by D<sub>1</sub> and the peak of prograde metamorphism corresponds to the delamination of the arc root and its incorporation into the Devonian subduction zone. Foundering is thought to have occurred as a consequence of the negative buoyancy of the arc root, owing to the large amount of ultramafic pyroxenites denser the ambient mantle (Müntener _et al._, 2001), The presence of ultramafic cumulates (_e.g._, pyrigarnites) in the *Bacariza* formation may have additionnally contributed to the gravitational instability of the arc root. These lithologies known as "arclogites" are indeed considered as some of the most likely candidates to undergo delamination in arc root settings (Ducea _et al._, 2021).

The *Herbeira* massif of Cabo Ortegal Complex could thus represent a unique example of delaminated arc root, potentially including the deep lithospheric portion of the sub-arc mantle.

### 5.3 Exhumation an emplacement

Fast exhumation seems to have rapidly followed the HP event (~1 GPa in < 10 Ma; Albert _et al._, 2012). The corresponding episode D<sub>2</sub> was mainly been reconstructed from the tectonothermal evolution of the eclogite-facies *Banded* gneiss (**Fig_exhumation-stages**) and cross-correlations with structures of the Órdenes Complex (Martínez Catalán _et al._, 2002). It corresponds to the underplating of the HP-HT units to form a unique assemblage at _ca._ 375 Ma (Ábalos _et al._, 2003, Albert _et al._, 2012), after 10-20 My within a subduction conduit, in good agreement with exhumation rates predicted by numerical models of syn-convergent extrusion (_e.g._, Beaumont _et al._, 2009).

**Fig_exhumation-stages**. Different stages of exhumation of the HP-HT units interpreted from the tectonothermal evolution of the eclogite-facies gneisses (Albert _et al._, 2012): **a.** development of a regional mylonitic foliation; **b.** syn-convergence extensional detachments and **c.** recumbent folds and thrusts; **d.** idealized cross section of the Cabo Ortegal Complex.

There is little record of D<sub>2</sub> (and subsequent episodes) in the ultramafic massifs, apart from the isoclinal folding of the *Uzal* peridotites and *Bacariza* granulites. However, several observations indicate that the peridotites were still relatively hot (Gayk & Kleinschrodt, 2000, Azcárraga _et al._, 2002, Ábalos _et al._, 2003). For instance, near the contact with the *Uzal* peridotites, the *Chimparra* gneisses provide extensive evidence of partial melting dated at 391 ± 8 Ma (Ordóñez Casado _et al._, 2001) and textures resembling those of high-grade contact metamorphism.

Development of recumbent folds and of a basal thrust (D<sub>3</sub>) accompanied retrograde metamorphism under amphibolite-facies conditions (including amphibolitization of the hydrated peridotites and pyroxenites). D<sub>3</sub> recumbent folds are additionally affected by upright folds without axial planar foliation (D<sub>4</sub>) such as the large open synform observed in the *Bacariza* granulites and in the *Herbeira* massif (**Fig_map-herbeira**). This last episode, potentially coeval with development of the THF, occurred under greenschist-facies conditions (Ábalos _et al._, 2003).

Final emplacement of Upper Allochthon on the Iberian parautochthon occurred at _ca._ 360 Ma (Dallmeyer _et al._, 1997).

## 6. Excursion stops

### Day 1: Herbeira massif (September 30<sup>th</sup>, full day)

This first day focusses on the *Herbeira* massif, which is the largest and most lithologically heterogeneous ultramafic massif of the Cabo Ortegal Complex (**Fig_map-herbeira**). It is split into three parts:

- In the morning, a 1-km walk from the *Vixía Herbeira* along the edge of the *Herbeira* cliffs, providing an overview of the lithological diversity of the cliffs in more accessible outcrops.
- Lunch at the *Chao do Monte* lookout in the *Uzal* peridotite massif (15-min drive)
- In the afternoon, a 2-km return walk along a dirt road to observe some intriguing features in the SW part of the massif.

**Fig_map-herbeira**. Location of the stops of the first day on the interpretative geological map of the *Herbeira* massif ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064), and references therein). **Stop 1.5** is located in the Uzal peridotite massif (not shown). **a.** Sheath-fold deformation cross-cutting lithological contacts. **b.** Area related to the Trans-Herbeira Fault surrounding the gradual contact between dunites and harzburgites, along the axial surface of the synform. Fault lines correspond either to strike-slip faults (continuous lines) or contacts (thrust patterns) with granulites. Cross sections sampled by Girardeau _et al._, (1989) and [Tilhac _et al._ (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064) are numbered **1-3** with the corresponding synthesic log shown for section 2. Note that the synformal structure of the massif is partly conditionned by the dunite body mapped along the SE boundary of the massif (Puelles _et al._, 2012). Outcrops that support the existence of this dunite are mostly limited to the area of the *Mina David*, an open pit mine exploited by *Pasek Minerales*. The extracted material indeed has a homogeneous content of 37 % MgO (Caballero _et al._, 2009) consistent with dunite compositions measured in the cliffs area ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)). Yet, it is also reported with a relatively high Opx content (Baragaño _et al._, 2019), which suggests that the protolith may actually harzburgitic, unless it relates to the incorporation of pyroxenite layers. The extracted material, so-called "dunite HT", is combined with periclase to produce high-temperature solid solutions which served as a refractory material in thermal power plants, steel manufacture and other applications.

#### Stop 1.1: "Vixía Herbeira" lookout

> **coordinates**:  43°43'25.15"N, 7°56'44.73"W

The first stop of the day is the lookout of the *Vixía Herbeira* (613 m), the highest point of the *Sierra de la Capelada* and one of the highest sea cliffs in Europe (**Fig_herbeira-lookout**). Its iconic landmark, the *Garita de Herbeira* (literally "Herbeira’s watchtower"), a stone construction from the 18<sup>th</sup> century, was part of a series of coastal watch posts. The current building, entirely made of ultramafic rocks, dates from 1805 and was renovated in 2003.

**Fig_herbeira-lookout**. **a.** View of the top part of the Herbeira cliffs below the *Vixía Herbeira*. **b.** View of the *Punta Robaliceira* from the *Vixía Herbeira*. Note the meaningfull name "Herbeira" for this very grassy area, derived from the Galician word *herba* (grass). Photo credit: R. Tilhac.

**Structure of the Herbeira massif**. From this point, we  introduce the main lithological variations of the massif (**Fig_map-herbeira**):

- To the N, down the *Punta Robaliceira*, serpentinized harzburgites occur along the shore line along with minor pyroxenites and wehrlites. Thanks to marine erosion, these rocks exhibit spectacular sheath folds (García-Izquierdo 2005, [Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)) similar to those described in the *Limo* massif (Puelles _et al._, 2012) and marked by a weakly defined foliation and well-developed linear fabric.
- To the NW, below us, abundant pyroxenites make up to 80-90 % of a ~3 km-long, 300 m-thick lenticular domain exposed in the *Herbeira* cliffs. Individual layers may reach up to 3 m in thickness with a lateral extent exceeding 100 m. They alternate mostly with dunites, particularly in the top and middle part of the pyroxenite-rich domain, and with harzburgites in its lower parts. This body preserve the best and most abundant pyroxenite outcrops of the complex, and among the largest amounts of pyroxenite in orogenic massifs worldwide. It has notably been investigated in detail through sampling of several cross sections sampled by Girardeau _et al._, (1989, 1990, 1991) and [Tilhac _et al._ (2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064), [2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1), [2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105346). Unfortunately, walking down the steeply dipping cliffs (about 65º) is not suitable for a large party. Detailed study of these cross sections suggest that the actual shape of the pyroxenite-rich domain may be more complex. Most pyroxenites are found between altitudes ~ 150 and ~ 350 m below us, whereas they are found at a higher altitude in the *Punta Robaliceira*'s section (~ 400-500 m), and to a lesser extent at ~ 300m. It may thus consist of a pile of at least two connected lenticular bodies and/or blocks of variable extent. Their detailed characterization is complicated by NW-trending Alpine faults, glacial geomormology (Alberti 2023) and recent landlisdes, some of which are currently active and monitored (Horacio _et al._, 2019a & b).

Sheath folds occurred in harzburgites in the foreground and in the pyroxenite-rich domain in the bottom-right corner of the cliffs. The *Vixía Herbeira* is located in the very top-left corner of the picture. Photo credit: R. Tilhac.

- To the W, in the lower part of the cliffs, sheath folds have been described in the lower part of the pyroxenite-rich domain ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)) indicating that the *Herbeira* massif probably underwent the related deformation episode (D<sub>1</sub>) as an entity, likely constrained by the presence of abundant pyroxenites, rheologically competent with respect to surrounding peridotites. This observation provide an important field confirmation that the main pyroxenites pre-date the Devonian subduction episode.
- To the NE, near the top of the ridge of *Punta Robaliceira*, a Grt-rich, 3 to 5 m-thick mafic layer was described by Girardeau and Gil Ibarguchi (1991), most likely unrelated to the main pyroxenites.
- To the S of the *Vixía Herbeira*, in a broad area along the cliff edge, a dunite-dominated domain outcrops associated with relatively abundant chromitites and locally wehrlitic bands.
- To the SE, a dominantly harzburgitic plateau represents the mantle tectonic that outcrops over most of the wind farm inland. Thin pyroxenite layers and minor dunite represent < 10 % in volume in this area which resembles exposures of the *Limo* and *Uzal* massif.

#### Stop 1.2: Type-1 pyroxenites

> **coordinates**:   43°43'18.13"N,   7°56'52.33"W

This outcrop (**Fig_type1-outcrop**) is an example of Ol-bearing clinopyroxenites and websterites that preserve dunite lenses (type-1 pyroxenites of [Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)).

**Fig_layered-clinopyroxenite-sample**. Example of type-1 pyroxenite sample interlayered with dunite ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)). Note the Ol-rich streak preserved within the thickest pyroxenite layer.

Type-1 pyroxenites represent among the earliest pyroxenite generations in Cabo Ortegal (see **Section 3.2**). They are, along with type 4, the most primitive type of pyroxenites, with 20-24 % MgO, 2-3 % Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and high Mg# of 87–89 (Cpx Mg# > 0.91; **Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**). Type-1 pyroxenites plot along the Fo-An join within the nepheline-normative, silica-deficient field in the Fo-CaTs-Qz projection. Such a trend towards the Fo apex is ascribed to melt-peridotite interaction in orogenic pyroxenites (Bodinier _et al._, 2008, Lambart _et al._, 2012).

In Cabo Ortegal, these pyroxenites are specifically interpreted as products of partial replacement of peridotites upon interaction with a Si-undersaturated melt called ultra-calcic picrite, as suggested by their high Cpx/Opx ratios which point to crystallization along a Cpx–Ol cotectic line. The incomplete remplacement reaction is indicated by the preservation of dunite lenses, suggesting that melt was the limiting reactant. Relatively low melt/rock ratios are supported by the lowest Amp  among the pyroxenites (6-14 %) as well as LILE and LREE enrichment limited to spoon-shaped patterns with flat heavy REE (HREE) (**Fig_REE-type1**). Yet, the occurrence of Ol-free type-1 pyroxenites suggests that the replacement process locally achieved complete consumption of Ol following a peritectic reaction Fo + Si-rich melt = En, indicating pressures < 1.2 GPa (_e.g._, Kelemen & Ghiorso, 1986).

#### Stop 1.3: Chromitites and type-2 & -3 pyroxenites

After passing by an isoclinal fold (**Fig_isoclinal-pyroxenite**), we reach the area of **Stop 1.3**, where reach the first chromitite outcrop of the day and most of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenite subtypes.

***Outcrop 1.3A***

The first outcrop of this stop is a sequence of several irregular layers or schlieren hosted in dunite. They extend laterally over several m with an individual thickness ranging from single grains to 3-4 cm (**Fig_chromitite-outcrop**). This occurrence corresponds to the semi-massive (< 80 % Chr), high-Cr# (0.75–0.82) chromitite (type II) of García-Tudela _et al._, (2024), which was classified in a broad group of Chr-rich dunite (< 75 % Chr) by [Moreno _et al._ (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601).

[Garcia-Tudela _et al._ (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2024.106109) suggested that the parental melt of the semi-massive (type-II) chromitites is a fore-arc basalt using empirical calculations based on the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> contents of Chr. This interpretation is further discussed along with the origin of the rest of Cabo Ortegal chromitites in **Stop 1.4** and **6**.

***Outcrop 1.3B***

Walking W, we encounter among other pyroxenite layers an example (not pictured here) of massive websterite (type-2 pyroxenites of [Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)). Most occurrences of this type are found in the central part of the pyroxenite-rich domain where massive outcrops reaching several m in thickness can be observed (_e.g._, **Fig_massive-pyroxenites**).

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/massive-pyroxenites.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_massive-pyroxenites**. **a.** Among the best example of massive (~ 3-m-thick) Spl-/Grt-facies pyroxenite (sample CO-006; [Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)) from the *Herbeira* cliffs (not included in this excursion. **b.** Fresh cut of a type-2 pyroxenite sample ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)).

Type-2 pyroxenites are likely to represent a latter generation of pyroxenites than type 1. They are more evolved with 20-21 % MgO, 3-6 % Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Mg# of 83-88 (Cpx Mg# of 0.88-0.92; **Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**). Type-2 pyroxenites plot along the En-CaTs join on the Fo-CaTs-Qz diagram, similarly to experimental pyroxenitic cumulates of hydrous basaltic andesite and high-Mg# andesite at 1.2 GPa (Müntener _et al._, 2001). Their Ol-free, lower Cpx/Opx modal compositions suggest that they crystallized from a Si-saturated (boninitic) melt, most likely distinct from the picritic melt parental to type-1 pyroxenites, as discussed in **Section 3.2**. However, some websterites (type 2) may represent more advanced product of the melt-peridotite interaction that produced type-1 pyroxenites at the expense of locally higher melt/rock ratios.

Higher and more variable melt/rock ratios in type-2 pyroxenites are indicated by variable LREE enrichment over nearly flat HREE (**Fig_REE-type2-4**), ascribed to chromatographic re-equilibration with incompatible-element enriched residual melts ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)). This enrichment was potentially enhanced by the (porosity-reducing) crystallization of hydrous residual melts, as suggested by higher proportions of Amp in type-2 pyroxenites (5-26 %). The process envisaged by [Tilhac _et al._ (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064) is similar to the percolative fractional crystallization model of Harte _et al._, (1993).

Outward percolation of excess residual melts metasomatized the host peridotites as well as pre-existing, type-1 pyroxenites. Tilhac _et al._, (2016) described a composite sample of type-1 pyroxenite that exhibit increasing Amp contents and a progressive LREE and LILE enrichment (**Fig_CO-010**). Formerly classified as a transitional sample between type-1 and type-3 pyroxenite, it probably represents the deformed product of a type-1 pyroxenite protolith mesomatized by the late-magmatic websteritic melts. Accordingly, [Gravestock (1992)](https://oro.open.ac.uk/65312/) reported a positive correlation between the amount of pyroxenites and the extent of LREE enrichment in the harzburgites.

Note the wehrlite streak preserved within the pyroxenite layer on the left-hand side ([Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)).

***Outcrop 1.3C***

Continuing towards the cliff edge, we reach the last outcrop of this stop (not pictured here), an example of strongly foliated pyroxenites (type 3 of [Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)).

These pyroxenites are characterized by the highest modal proportion of Amp (8-43 %) among Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites. Their major-element compositions overlap with those of type-1 and type -2 pyroxenites (**Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**). Most type-3 pyroxenites mimic the high MgO of type 1 wheras others reach similarly high Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as type-2 pyroxenites (**Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**). However, they differ in having a higher Na<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>O (up to 0.8-0.9 %) and systematically LREE-enriched patterns with negative MREE-to-HREE slopes (**Fig_REE-type3**).

Most type-3 pyroxenites are interpreted as the deformed and hydrated (amphibolitized) products of the other two types, preferentially type-1 pyroxenites. Dunite lenses and layers may have indeed provided preferential pathways for fluids percolation and deformation localization in type-1 pyroxenite protoliths (**Fig_amphibolitization**).

Sketch depicting the model proposed by [Tilhac (2017)](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1) & [Henry _et al._ (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.05.028) for the formation of type-3 pyroxenites, preferentially from on a protolith similar to those of type-1 pyroxenites; increasing deformation by axial compression and shear eventually stacks pyroxenites layers (**1 & 2**) creating preferential pathways for fluid percolation and amphibolitization (**3**).

Accordingly, where sheath folds affect pyroxenites (in the lower part of the pyroxenite-rich domain), the latter are systematically of type 3, and particularly strongly amphibolitized (_e.g._, **Fig_hornblendite-sample**). This observation suggests that most of the hydration was syn-kinematic of the high-shear strain deformation episode (D<sub>1</sub>) and that metamorphic amphibolitization (which produced undeformed idiomorphic Amp) is mostly post-kinematic and contemporaneous to the regional amphibolite-facies metamorphism during exhumation stage D<sub>3</sub>.

#### Stop 1.4: Massive chromitites & type-4 pyroxenites

We reach the area around **Stop 1.4** where most of the chromitite outcrops of the *Herbeira* massif are encountered. This area was mapped in detail by [Monterrubio Pérez (1991)](https://docta.ucm.es/entities/publication/fda0fa77-a464-4c62-a271-a50d4da99ba3) (**Fig_map-Monterrubio-Perez**), who first discovered platiniferous chromitite here. Chromium and Pt concentrations were measured along trenches dug by the *Empresa Nacional Adaro de Investigaciones Mineras* (ENADIMSA), one the ancestors of the Spanish geological survey. Subsequent investigation of these chromitites by Moreno (1999) revealed concentrations > 13 000 ppb ΣPGE, with Pt and Pd being much more concentrated (10 900 ppb) than Os, Ir and Ru (< 1365 ppb).

The main outcrop is a massive chromitite hosted in dunite. It is one of the most spectacular of the *Herbeira* massif as it features oblique cross sections through a sequence of irregular chromitite layers sandwiched between layered pyroxenites and dunites  (**Fig_chromitites**).

This occurrence corresponds to the massive (> 80 % Chr), intermediate-Cr# (0.60–0.66) chromitite (type I) of García-Tudela _et al._, (2024), classified as chromitites _sensu stricto_ (_i.e._ > 75 % Chr) by [Moreno _et al._ (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601). This outcrop also yielded some of the highest PGE concentrations measured in the Cabo Ortegal chromitites.

***Outcrop 1.4B***

About 50 m away, we encounter the second outcrop of this stop; which exhibits among the best examples of Opx-rich websterites and orthopyroxenites (type-4 pyroxenites of [Tilhac _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egw064)). It is noteworthy that this type is abundant in this area, often spatially associated with chromitites, while it is relatively rare in the rest of the *Herbeira* massif except, but to a lesser extent, in the lower dunite exposed in *Punta Robaliceira*.

Type-4 pyroxenites exhibit the highest Mg# (and Cr#) and lowest Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> of all types of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites. They are interpreted as the most primitive products of the low-Ca boninite parental to type-2 pyroxenites (and possibly also of the chromitites, as suggested by their spatial association with type-4 pyroxenites). Indeed, the combination of their Opx-rich and primitive characters cannot be reconciled with the ultra-calcic picrite inferred from type-1 pyroxenites. This interpretation is consistent with the highly variable REE compositions of their Cpx, comparable to the extremely depleted and enriched endmembers of type-2 pyroxenites (**Fig_REE-type2-4**). This is an expected chromatographic consequence of the lower modal proportions of Cpx in type-4 pyroxenites (_e.g._, Godard _et al._, 1995).

The field occurrence of type-4 pyroxenites is dominated by very coarse-grained pods or boudins that appear to be wrapped by the foliation of the host harzburgites (**Fig_orthopyroxenite-sample**; **Fig_type4-pods**). This observation may reflect a combination of a greater competence owing to their higher Opx content and the fact that they represent a later generation of pyroxenites (along with type 2), less affected by HT deformation.

#### Stop 1.5: "Chao do Monte" lookout

The *Chao do Monte* (literally "flatland of the hill") lookout (360 m) is a pasture for cows and horses near the NE edge of the ultramafic massif of *Uzal*. It provides great views to the NE  towards the granulites and *Herbeira* cliffs  (**Fig_Uzal-panorama**).

> NOTE: Add information/contacts on the image.

To the W, we can observe the rest of the folded Uzal massif down to the *Playa de Cortés* beach and the *Chimparra*  gneiss outcropping forming the ridge of *Punta Tarroiba* (**Fig_uzal_a**). The area also features peridotite outcrops, including pyroxenite-bearing ones, particularly near the contact onto the granulites (**Fig_uzal_b**).

It is noteworthy that the *Uzal* peridotites here overlie the Opx-free granulites and associated Si-poor Fe-Ti-rich rocks (pyrigarnites, hornblendites) owing to a fold picture in **Fig_Uzal-fold**.

#### Stop 1.6: Chromitites associated with pyroxenites

> NOTE: to incorporate:  
 The observed differences between the two chromitite groups are indeed relatively small and could simply owe to subsolidus re-equilibration (_e.g._, Pagé & Barnes 2009; [Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)). 
 the latter relies on empirical calculations based on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> contents in chromitites yield two parental melt compositions comparable to a fore-arc (_i.e._ low-Ti) basalt and a boninite for type-I and type-II chromitites, respectively 

This highly heterogeneous outcrops exhibit a folded sequence of dunite interlayered with pyroxenites and various chromitites, occurring both as irregular layers with sharp boundaries and variable thickness (locally forming pods) as well as trails of variously concentrated disseminated grains (**Fig_chromitites-group-b**).

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/chromitites-type-b.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_chromitites-group-b**. **a.** Overview of the outcrop. **b-c.** Details of the association of chromitite with pyroxenite layers. **d.** Details of variously concentrated Spl grains disseminated in dunite ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)).

While most chromitites hosted in the upper dunite have a relatively high Cr#, comparable to chromite in boninites (Barnes & Roedder, 2001), chromitite samples from this outcrop (group-B chromitites of [Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)) have a markedly lower Cr#, overlapping with Spl compositions in the pyroxenites (**Fig_spl-summary**).

 Overall, Spl compositions in Cabo Ortegal show a strong control of both Cr-Al and Fe-Ti trends ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)), resulting in a well-defined Spl gap around the solid solution solvus (Sack & Ghiorso, 1991).
- The Cr-Al trend, commonly observed in mantle terranes and xenoliths is mostly seen in type-1 pyroxenites. It is mainly interpreted as the result of subsolidus re-equilibration between Spl and silicates (Barnes & Roeder, 2001). 
- The Fe-Ti trend, commonly observed in mafic intrusions and arc-related ultramafic complexes, is seen in type-2 and type-3 pyroxenites. It is interpreted as the result of re-equilibration with residual melts and/or increasing oxidation state (Pagé & Barnes, 2009).

**Fig_spl-summary**. **a-b.** Compositionnal fields of Spl in the Cabo Ortegal chromitites ([Moreno _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601), [Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1), [Garcia-Tudela _et al._, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2024.106109)), peridotites ([Santos _et al._, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/43.1.17)) and pyroxenites ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)).  **c.** Compositional fields of spinel from different metamorphic facies are from García-Tudela _et al._, (2024) and references therein. **d.** Schematic representation of the main trends governing the compositions of terrestrial spinels after Barnes & Roedder (2001).

Compared to peridotites and pyroxenites, the relatively narrow range of Mg# (0.35-0.50) and high Cr contents observed in chromtites indicates more limited re-equilibration processes (except for the lower Cr# of group-B chromitites). Slight differences between massive (type-I) and semi-massive (type-II) chromitites, which were ascribed by Garcia-Tudela _et al._, (2024) to distinct parental melts, may also reflect variable extent of subsolidus re-equilibration. Massive chromitites are indeed the least likely to suffer from subsolidus re-equilibration with silicates and accordingly overlap with the compositional field of chromite in boninites (Barnes & Roedder, 2001), probably reflecting their actual parental melts.

#### Stop 1.7: The Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF)

After walking further 500 m along the dirt road, we reach the area inferred as the location intersected by the Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF), named by Moreno (1999) following original observations by [Monterrubio Pérez (1991)](https://docta.ucm.es/entities/publication/fda0fa77-a464-4c62-a271-a50d4da99ba3). 

[Moreno _et al._ (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601) described the THF as a NNE-SSW brittle fault with a dextral shear sense, based on observations of brecciated ultramafic cataclasites with N-plunging lineations, particularly in farm excavations 125 m NE from the *Vixía Herbeira* (**Fig_map-herbeira-evolution**).

<img src="cabo-ortegal/fieldguide_figures/map-herbeira-evolution.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_map-herbeira-evolution**. **a-b.** Different geological maps of the *Herbeira* massif. In **a** and **d**, the contact between the E and W part of the massif is considered as primary (and the massif interpreted as a synform). In **c** and **d**, it is considered as tectonic along the Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF) or Trans-Herbeira Shear Zone (THSZ).

In contrast, García-Izquierdo (2005) described this structure as a ~200-m-wide Trans Herbeira Shear Zone (THSZ) where deformation is concentrated in cm- to m-thick mylonitic bands (**Fig_thf-cross-section**). In the cross section near **Stop 1.7**, a grain-size decrease is observed in the Amp-rich peridotites as the structure is approach, accompanied by an increasingly dipping planar fabric which progressively aligns to the near-vertical mylonitic bands, cutting the compositional layering at a very low angle (**Fig_thf-cross-section**). Subhorizontal lineations in the area are defined by the stretching of Px  and the orientation of Amp aggregates, similarly oriented to lineations observed across the massif. The anastomosing structure of the mylonitic bands indicate a sinistral movement in a transtensional regime, as suggested by SSW-plunging lineations (García-Izquierdo, 2005). The THF/THSZ is inferred to have normal component with the eastern block as hanging wall and an estimated vertical displacement of 400 m.

Adapted and translated from García Izquierdo (2005).

Of interest here, the existence and nature of the THF/THSZ conditions our understanding of the structure of the *Herbeira* massif. Two interpretations are possible:
  - If it is a major structure with significant displacement, the massif may consist of two tectonically distinct units, interpreted as a lower-crustal layered sequence to the E and a mantle tectonic to the W, respectively ([Moreno _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs.158.4.601), García Izquierdo _et al._, 2011).
  - It it is only a minor structure with limited displacement, the lithological heterogeneity of the massif must be considered as a whole (Girardeau _et al._, 1989, Abalos _et al._, 2000, Puelles 2003), potentially forming an open synformal structure whose axial surface would be slightly oblique to the THF, (Ábalos _et al._, 2000, Puelles 2003), as suggested by foliation trajectories (see **Fig_map-herbeira**)

More recently, Tilhac (2017) reported field observations where relatively fresh outcrops are preserved, indicating that the contact between harzburgites and dunites can be observed as a gradual increase in the proportion of Opx porphyroclasts over a few hundred metres (**Fig_dunite-harzburgite-transition**). These observations support the latter interpretation in the sense that the THF does not put the harzburgites and dunites in tectonic contact, regardless of its brittle/ductile nature.

**Fig_harzburgite-dunite-samples**. Example of harzburgite and dunite samples ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)).

Nonetheless, the area is affected by significant fluid circulation (**Fig_THF-features**), evidenced by high degrees of serpentinization and/or amphibolitization, and abundant quartz (Qtz) and asbestiform chrysotile (Ctl) veining.  Sub-vertical Grt-Chl-bearing veins were reported by [Tilhac (2017)](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1) to the SW (**Stop 1.7**). Intrusions rich in Phl and Ap have been described associated with the mylonites by García-Izquierdo (2005). Demantoid (Cr-rich andrandite Grt) associated with Chl-Srp veins was interpreted as coeval to the end of the greenschist-facies retrograde metamorphism (< 450 ºC, Madon _et al._, 1991). 

Based on these observations, the THF is interpreted as a late structure where fluid-assisted faulting might have occurred locally (as indicated by breccias) and limited to minor displacement. It probably post-dates the thrusting of the massif onto the granulite ([Tilhac, 2017](https://doi.org/10.25949/22281616.v1)), as suggested by talc-Chl-Srp-rich rocks (soapstone) exposed near the contact with granulites (Moreno, 1999). We further speculate that it may relate to local extensional regime around the axial surface of the synformal axial plane, potentially re-activating pre-existing mantle shear zones near the harzburgite-dunite transition. Shear zones might have also formed locally facilitated by rheological weakening induced by the presence of fluids/melts.

***Outcrop 1.7A***

The first outcrop of this stop corresponds to the Grt-Chl-rich veins (**Fig_THF-features_e-f**). 

***Outcrop 1.7B***

The second outcrop features Chl-rich harzburgites. In the Cabo Ortegal litterature, the presence of Chl in the peridotites has been ascribed to a late metamorphic overprint in the greenschist facies, in spite of the fact that this phase is stable in hydrated peridotites at pressures up to 6-7 GPa (_e.g._, Hacker et al., 2003). More recently, it has been related to hydration and temperature decrease < 800 ºC at HP (**Fig_limo-phase-diagram.**) and interpreted as reflecting the incorporation of the ultramafic massifs into a subduction channel, as discussed in **Section 5.2**. This interpretation is consistent with synkinematic oriented nature of Chl, particularly in the sheath-folded area at *Punta Robaliceira* (see **Fig_sheath-folds**).

**Stop 1.7B** also features folded Grt-rich pyroxenite dykes deformed in mylonites near the contacts (**Fig_grt-pyroxenite-fold.**). It is noteworthy that folding of such dykes is limited to mylonites in the vicinity of the granulite contacts.

#### Stop 1.8: Layered pyroxenites (optional)

Time and weather allowing, we can walk in small groups to see one of the rare outcrops of thick layered pyroxenites and dunites accessible without having to hike down the cliffs. The outcrop is located 100 m from the road in a steep but accessible ridge at the top of the *Punta Robaliceira* cross section (1; **Fig_map-herbeira**).

### Day 2: Overview of the Cabo Ortegal Complex (October 1<sup>st</sup>, half day)

This half day aims to cover most of the lithological diversity of the mafic HP-HT units to discuss the overall geology of the Cabo Ortegal Complex (_i.e.._ Si-poor Fe-Ti-rich rocks, Opx-free Grt granulites, eclogites). It is split into three parts (**Fig_day2-stops**):
- In the morning, three easily accessible lookouts along the coast (*Chan dos Carrís*, *Cruceiro do Cuturelo* and *Miradoiro do Limo*)
- Lunch near the eclogite-granulite contact after a 2-km walk from the last mirador to the *Pico Gargacido-Monte Faroleiro* area.
- In the early afternoon, group picture at the most scenic lookout of the Cabo Ortegal lighthouse on eclogite outcrops.

#### Stop 2.1: “Chan dos Carrís” lookout

> **coordinates**: 43.699761, -7.987705

This first stop of the second day (**Fig_chan-dos-carris**) is located in a band of Si-poor (ultramafic to mafic) Fe-Ti-rich rocks that outcrop between the *Uzal* peridotite massif and the banded granulites, which we are the aim of the next stop (**Fig_XX**). As noted in **Section 4**, these rocks are mainly of Cpx (augite to omphacite), Grt, and Amp (pargasite) in varying proportions.  They range from pyrigarnites (dominated by Grt-Cpx ), to hornblendites (dominated by Amp), with all grades in between (**Fig. 4.X**). They are generally coarse- to medium-grained, but finer-grained rocks due to intense deformation are also found. Plagioclase is typically < 5 % or even absent, although its content locally increase owing to partial melting (**Fig. 4.X**).

Note that the term “pyrigarnites” was coined here by [Vogel (1967)](https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/505641). Due to their resemblance to eclogites and the lack of Plg, the pyrigarnites have also been referred to as eclogites _sensu lato_ in the Cabo Ortegal literature (_e.g._, Galán and Marcos, 2000), to distinguish them from the main *Concepenido* eclogites, which are the aim of **Stops 2.4** and **2.5**. Pyrigarnites are sometimes referred to as Grt clinopyroxenites or more specifically low-Mg Grt clinopyroxenites. More recently, they have been classified as "arclogites", a term that also encompasses pyribolites (Px-Amp), Gry pyroxenites, and others rocks typically formed in arc-root settings (see [Ducea _et al._, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103375)).

The Si-poor Fe-Ti-rich rocks exhibit a strong planolinear texture (LS tectonites, **Fig. 6.2.1**). Here, the pyrigranites show a penetrative foliation with no development of structures such as transposed foliations or lineations, folds or boudins. However, lenses and boudins of pyrigarnites are commonly found embedded in the Opx-free garnet granulites (see examples in **Section 4**). These rocks show ample evidence of plastic deformation (dislocation creep), including microstructures developped within grains (**REF***) and strong preferential crystallographic orientations in the main minerals (**Fig. 6.2.2**). Spectacular examples of trondhjemitic veins cutting the tectonic foliation are also observed in the pyrigarnites, although not in this outcrop (**Fig. 4.X**).

**Fig 6.2.2**. Typical CPO (crystallographic preferred orientation) patterns of the main minerals in the Si-poor Fe-Ti-rich rocks. Omphacite shows CPO patterns ranging from LS to L types, with most c-axes oriented parallel to the lineation and b-axes and a-axes defining an imperfect girdle normal to the lineation, suggesting plain to prolate strain (_e.g._, [Keppler, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsg.2018.04.003)). Pargasite typically shows c-axis alignment parallel to the mineral lineation and a-axis alignment normal to the foliation (_i.e._ Type I of [Ko and Jung, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7586)). Plagioclase exhibits variable CPO patterns ranging from weak to moderate in intensity. Garnet displays random CPO patterns (not shown here). Other less volumetrically significant minerals, such as Zo and epidote (Ep), also develop strong CPO. Upper hemisphere equal area projections, contours in multiples of a uniform distribution.

The literature on the Cabo Ortegal Complex provides limited inferences  on the origin of these rocks. This aspect, as well as the nature of the contact between the *Uzal* massif and the Si-poor, Fe-Ti-rich rocks, is discussed on the field. 

Galán & Marcos (1997) interpreted this contact as a continuous transition from mantle to lower crust (_i.e._ paleo-Moho), while other authors (_e.g._, Ábalos _et al._, 2003; Puelles _et al._, 2009) consider that all the HP-HT Unit of the Cabo Ortegal Complex are in tectonic contacts while others argue that some of these contacts are igneous. Based on the paleo-Moho assumption, [Brown _et al._, (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2009.05.032) and [Llana-Fúnez & Brown (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1130/B30568.1) proposed that the petrological and seismic Moho are distinct owing to the seismic properties of the Si-poor, Fe-Ti-rich rocks that closely resemble those of peridotites. 

#### Stop 2.2: “Cruceiro do Cuturelo” lookout

> **coordinates**: 43.711971, -7.972684

This lookout, marked by a small stone cross (known locally in Galician as a "cruceiro"), is part of the pilgrimage route to the sanctuary of the village of *San Andrés de Teixido*. On a clear day, this viewpoint also offers excellent panoramic views of the *Herbeira* to the E and *Uzal* massif to the W (**Fig_san-andres-panorama**). The aim of this stop is to observe the Opx-free garnet granulites of the *Bacariza* formation.

As detailed in **Section 4**, the *Bacariza* formation exhibits a wide compositional range, from mafic to acidic, leading to significant variations in mineral content. The rocks are primarily composed of Grt, Cpx (augite to omphacite), Amp (pargasite), Plg, Qtz, and Zo/Ep in variable proportions. In **Stop 2.2**, the granulites are relatively Plg-rich (~ 30-50 %; **Fig. 6.2.3** and **6.2.4**), corresponding to the mafic facies (most common). Grain sizes vary greatly from coarse- to fine-grained, depending on the degree of strain.

In the Cabo Ortegal literature, these granulites are often referred to as layered or banded granulites (**Fig. 6.2.3**). Most of the granulites indeed exhibit a planolinear texture (LS tectonites; **Fig. 6.2.3**) with the compositional layering frequently described as a mylonitic foliation. In **Stop 2.2**, they show a very monotonic and penetrative layering without transposed foliations, lineations, folds or boudins. (which are seen in other outcrops; **Section 4**). The Opx-free garnet granulites provide ample evidence of plastic deformation (dislocation creep), as recorded in microstructures within grains (references) and the development of strong preferential crystallographic orientations in all major minerals (**Fig. 6.2.5**). The interpretation of deformation stages and their relationship to major structures, such as regional folds and shear zones, as well as the metamorphic evolution, remains a topic of active debate, as detailled in **Section 4**.

**Fig. 6.2.5**.  Typical CPO patterns of the main minerals in the Cabo Ortegal granulites ([Puelles _et al._, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsg.2009.05.001); [Llana-Fúnez and Brown, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1130/B30568.1)). Omphacite shows CPO patterns ranging from LS to, more rarely, L types, with most c-axes oriented parallel to the lineation and b-axes either normal to the foliation (LS type) or forming an imperfect girdle normal to the lineation (L type). Pargasite typically has its c-axis parallel to the mineral lineation and the a-axis normal to the foliation (_i.e._ Type I of [Ko and Jung, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7586). Garnet displays weak to moderate intensity CPO patterns with <111> axes parallel to the lineation and, more rarely, random patterns. Plagioclase shows a wide variability of CPO patterns from weak to moderate in intensity. In some samples. Qtz exhibits an unusual CPO pattern with the c-axis aligned close to the mineral lineation, indicative of a dominant prism c-slip only observed > 650 ºC  ([Mainprice _et al._, 1986](https://doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1986)14%3C819:DCSIND%3E2.0.CO;2)). Other samples show dominant a-slip. Strong CPO are also observed in less volumetrically important minerals such as Zo and Ep..

#### Stop 2.3: "Miradoiro do Limo" lookout

> **coordinates**: 43.746342094580456, -7.8905053056528685

This is a short stop to observe the Chl-Amp-bearing harzburgites of the *Limo* massif, visible on the slope above the lookout. Weather allowing, this lookout offers a great view of *Cariño*, a fishing town whose port is now used for storing and exporting peridotites mined from the *Mina David* in the *Herbeira* Massif (see **Fig_map-herbeira**). To the S of *Cariño* is the *Ría de Ortigueira*, one of the *Rías Altas* of Galicia(**Fig_miradoiro-do-limo**).  The geomorphological term "ría" (Galician for "stream") refers to drowned river valleys that have been flooded by the sea, somewhat equivalent to a fjord for flooded glacial valley (Castaing & Guilcher 1995, and references therein). It was originally define in defined to refer to coastal landforms of Galicia and other parts of Spain and Portugal  (_e.g._, Pérez Moreira & Barral Silva 2003).

The *Ría de Ortigueira* is the estuary of the *Mera* river and an important passage and wintering area for water birds. It is roughly developped along the E contact between the Upper and Lower Tectonic units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex. On the right-hand side, we can also observe the ridge that forms part of the 20 km-long band of eclogites of the *Concepenido* formation (**Fig_miradoiro-do-limo**), which are the aim of the next stop.

#### Stop 2.4: Pico Gargacido - Monte Faroleiro

> **coordinates**: 43.763404, -7.870507

The transition from granulites to eclogites occurs in the pass between *Monte Faroleiro* and *Pico Gargacido*. In *Monte Faroleiro* (**Fig_gargacido-faroleiro_a**), the Opx-free Grt granulites exhibit intermediate compositions and clear evidence of migmatisation (Fig. 6.2.6). In contrast, *Pico Gargacido* is formed by a deformed facies of the "common" eclogites (**Fig_gargacido-faroleiro_b**).

These eclogites are medium- to fine-grained, mainly of Grt  (~Alm<sub>45</sub>Grs<sub>24</sub>Prp<sub>30</sub>), Cpx (omphacite), Amp (pargasite), Zo, Qtz and Rt. Modal compositions range from Grt-Cpx dominated rocks (up to 85 %) Amp-Zo-rich varieties (**Fig. 6.2.6** and **6.2.7**). Symplectite coronas containing Cpx and Na-rich Plg are common, although Plg content is < 2 %.

Eclogites near **Stop 2.4** display a planolinear fabric (LS tectonites), with a NNE-SSW (orogen-parallel) lineation. Several examples of centimetric to decametric shear zones can be observed in this outcrop (**Fig. 6.2.6**). These shear zones are enriched in Zo and Amp compared to the precursor eclogites (**Fig. 6.2.6** and **6.2.7**). It is also common to observe zones transitioning from garnet-rich to amphibole-rich eclogites all over the place. Local evidence of partial melting is present in the eclogites but is less widespread and less pronounced than in the adjacent granulites. The eclogites show extensive evidence of plastic deformation (dislocation creep) both within and outside the mylonitic zones, where omphacite, amphibole and zoisite show strong CPO while garnet shows weak to random CPO (Fig. 6.2.8) (cf. [Ábalos, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0191-8141(97)00001-1); [Llana-Fúnez _et al._, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2005.03.007)).

**Fig. 6.2.7.** EBSD phase maps of eclogite samples from *Pico Gargacido*, illustrating the enrichment of Zo and Amp with progressive deformation from deformed LS tectonite to mylonite. Note the increase in the contents of Zo (purple) from 8 % (**top**), 18 % (**middle**) to 25 % (**bottom**), and of Amp (orange; from 17, 21 to 32 %). Unpublished data from the OUTCROP project (M.A. Lopez-Sanchez; [SV-PA-21-AYUD/2021/57163](https://marcoalopez.github.io/OUTCROPproject/)).

Mineral assemblages within the shear zones, particularly the Zo enrichment (Fig. 6.2.7), suggest formation in the presence of water at HP-HT with only a moderate decrease in temperature relative to peak metamorphic conditions. This aspect is further discussed in the field.

**Fig 6.2.8.** Typical CPO patterns of the main minerals in the eclogites. Omphacite shows an S-type CPO pattern where the b-axis oriented normal to the foliation and the a- and c-axes randomly arranged within the foliation, indicating pure shear deformation (e.g., [Keppler, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsg.2018.04.003)) . Pargasite shows a pattern that mimics that of the omphacite. Zoisite has its c-axis normal to the foliation and the a- and b-axes aligned with the foliation. The b-axis may be randomly oriented in the foliation plane (as shown) or display a point maximum slightly oblique to the mineral lineation in shear zones (not shown), suggesting a simple shear component locally. Garnet shows weak (as shown) to random CPO with <111> axes aligning with the lineation. Upper hemisphere equal area projections, contours in multiples of a uniform distribution.

#### Stop 2.5: Cabo Ortegal lighthouse

> **coordinates**: 43.771119, -7.869959

This last stop of the excursion is the Cabo Ortegal lighthouse (built in 1984), one of the iconic landmarks of the area. It offers panoramic view of the mantle rocks of the *Limo* massif in contact with intermediate Opx-free garnet granulites to the SW (**Fig 6.2.9a**). Looking N, on a clear day (ideally with sunset light), a spectacular tight fold with a wavelength of hundreds of meters can be seen one in the eclogites of one of the islets (*Os Aguillons*; **Fig 6.2.9b**). Except in such cases, these folds are challenging to discern on outcrops and mostly have to be inferred from geological mapping. The eclogites rheology, similar to that of peridotites (e.g. [Jin _et al._, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029%3C0667:ERIFSL%3E2.0.CO;2)), suggests that folding occurred under HP-HT conditions. To the E, at the base of the cliffs (not shown), outcrops of the HP paragneiss known as *Banded* gneiss complete the typical sequence of the *La Capelada* sub-unit within the Upper Tectonic Unit.

The purpose of this stop is also to observe the massive eclogites on which the lighthouse tands. Unlike the eclogites at the previous stop, these eclogites show no clear lineation, and their foliation is weaker, representing S tectonites (see **Fig. 4.4b**).
