This was my PhD research project, which aimed to contribute to the understanding of the:
- petrogenesis of pyroxenites in the sub-arc mantle;
- overprint of subduction-related metasomatism and metamorphism;
- the variability of source and timing of pyroxenite formation;
- deformation of pyroxenites in layered mantle domains;
- seismic properties of pyroxenite-rich mantle via numerical modelling;
- associated tectonic and geodynamic processes.
