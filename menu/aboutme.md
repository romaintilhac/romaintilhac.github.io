I am an Earth scientist from the French Pyrenees currently working as a CSIC post-doctoral researcher in mantle petrology and geochemistry at the [Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra (IACT)](https://www.iact.ugr-csic.es/en/) in Granada, Spain. I am also a climber and caver, passionate about mountains, traveling and photography.
