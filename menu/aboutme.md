I am geochemist currently working as CSIC post-doctoral researcher at the Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra (IACT) in Granada, Spain

My research relates to the compositional evolution of the Earthâ€™s mantle through the study of mafic and ultramafic terranes and xenoliths. I use trace-element and isotope geochemistry and petrological modelling to understand the genesis of mantle-derived magmas, their sources and differentiation processes. I am especially interested in elemental mobility and isotopic fractionation in the sub-arc mantle and the role of melt-peridotite interaction during the formation of pyroxenites.

I am also a climber and caver, passionate about mountains, travelling and photography.
