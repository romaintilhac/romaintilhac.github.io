I am Earth scientist from the French Pyrenees currently working as a CSIC post-doctoral researcher at the [Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra (IACT)](https://www.iact.ugr-csic.es/en/) in Granada, Spain.

I am also a climber and caver, passionate about mountains, travelling and photography. Check out my pictures on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/108939669@N03/).
