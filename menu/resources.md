**Percolation-diffusion model**

MATLAB code to compute the diffusional re-equilibration of REE in a solid matrix of spherical mantle minerals percolated by a melt in a 1D column. It is the implementation of the numerical model described in [Tilhac *et al.* (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36753-0) is available on GitHub (https://github.com/romaintilhac/percolation-diffusion.git) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/ zenodo.8475).
