My research relates to the compositional evolution of the Earthâ€™s mantle through the study of mafic and ultramafic terranes and xenoliths. I use trace-element and isotope geochemistry and petrological modelling to understand the genesis of mantle-derived magmas, their sources and differentiation processes. I am especially interested in elemental mobility and isotopic fractionation in the sub-arc mantle and the role of melt-peridotite interaction during the formation of pyroxenites.
