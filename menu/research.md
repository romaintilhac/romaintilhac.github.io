My research relates to the compositional evolution of the Earth’s mantle through the study of mafic and ultramafic terranes and xenoliths. I use trace-element and isotope geochemistry and petrological modelling to understand the genesis of mantle-derived magmas, their sources and differentiation processes. I am especially interested in elemental mobility and isotopic fractionation in the sub-arc mantle and the role of melt-peridotite interaction during the formation of pyroxenites.

## Current projects

### Source, melting and lithospheric processes during basalt genesis

Constraining the impact of melting and lithospheric melt-rock interaction processes to identify the signature of recycled lithologies and other source components in primary oceanic basalts, intra-plate volcanics and associated xenoliths.

### Petrological and geochemical modelling of mantle magmatism

Collaborative development and use of various numerical modelling tools: diffusion, percolation-diffusion, open-system melting, mixed-source melting, reactive transport models.

### Deep differentiation of arc magmas

Characterizing the nature and composition of magmatic products (and their metamorphic and metasomatic overprints) in the sub-arc mantle and lower crust to constrain:
- the impact of fluid-melt-rock interaction on the evolution of arc magmas;
- the impact of their potential recycling on the dynamics and magmatism of the convective mantle.

### High-temperature radiogenic isotope geochemistry

Analytical applications and modelling of radiogenic isotope systems (mainly Hf-Nd but also Sr, Pb, Os) to tracing and dating in high-temperature geochemical problems.

## Previous projects

### Cabo Ortegal Complex pyroxenites

This was my PhD research project, which aimed to contribute to the understanding of the:
- petrogenesis of pyroxenites in the sub-arc mantle;
- overprint of subduction-related metasomatism and metamorphism;
- the variability of source and timing of pyroxenite formation;
- deformation of pyroxenites in layered mantle domains;
- seismic properties of pyroxenite-rich mantle via numerical modelling;
- associated tectonic and geodynamic processes.
