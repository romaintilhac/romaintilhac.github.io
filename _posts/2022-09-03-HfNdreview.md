The idea behind this work is to propose a global review in the context of all published Hf- and Nd-isotope data in mantle rocks motivated by the lack of such an exhaustive compilation despite the increasing body of data published over the last 20 years (> 1100 combined Hf-Nd analyses; **Fig. 1**).

***Fig. 1.** Present-day Hf- and Nd-isotope compositions in ƐNd-ƐHf space for the whole dataset compiled in this review.*

We have compiled all published Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf isotope data on abyssal, ophiolitic and orogenic peridotites massifs as well as basalt- and kimberlite-borne xenoliths (see the maps of localities included; **Fig. 2**) This database is described in order to provide an updated view on the origin and significance of the ancient isotopic signatures identified in oceanic lavas and abyssal peridotites.

The final version came out as an invited review to *Chemical Geology* and it's open access, so I hope it will be of much help to many!
