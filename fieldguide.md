## 1. Introduction

The Cabo Ortegal Complex is known to the mantle community for its ultramafic massifs that preserve some of the best outcrops of pyroxenite among orogenic massifs worldwide (**Fig_layered-pyroxenites-1**). The main objective of this two-day excursion is to showcase some of these outcrops and get an overview of the geology of the complex. 

- On the first day, we will focus on the mantle rocks exposed in the largest and most lithologically heterogeneous massif of *Herbeira*.
- On the second, we will cover key petrological and structural features of other high-pressure units of the complex (granulites and eclogites).

It is noteworthy that most of the Cabo Ortegal Complex is part of the *Xeoparque do Cabo Ortegal*, officially established as a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2024. This designation aims to promote and preserve the outstanding rock formations and outcrops of the complex, as well as rias, islets, coves, beaches, and lagoons of significant geomorphological interest. The park spans 800 km² of land and marine areas rich in biodiversity, cultural heritage and gastronomic traditions.

## 2. Geological setting

The Cabo Ortegal Complex (Vogel 1967), located in NW Spain as part of the Iberian section of the Variscan Orogen (**Fig_geological-setting_a**). Along with the Appalachian (Alleghanian) and Ural, this orogenic belt records the Paleozoic collision of Laurussia (_i.e._ Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia) and Gondwana (_e.g._, Matte 2002). The Variscan Orogen specifically represents a Late Paleozoic belt that extends from Morocco through Iberia to Central Europe.

**Fig_geological-setting**. **a.** Map of the Variscan Orogen in Western and Central Europe prior to Mesozoic times, showing the location of the NW Iberian complexes and other European Variscides. Adapted from Franke (1989), Lefort (1989), Newman and Max (1989) and Martínez-Catalán (2011). Note that the northern front of the orogen (Laurussian realm, in brown), is clearly delineated, particularly from Germany to England and in the SW of the Iberian Peninsula, where the South Portuguese Zone is interpreted as a detached Laurussian terrane. In contrast, the S front of the orogen (Gondwanan realm, in yellow and green), has been significantly reworked in the Cenozoic by the Alpine orogeny, partly hindering the correlation of pre-Mesozoic terranes across Europe. **b.** Map of the pre-Mesozoic outcrops of the Iberian Peninsula among which the Iberian Massif is the largest. **c.** Classical tectonic zonation of the Iberian Massif highlighting the allochthonous complexes (in dark green) of the *Galicia-Trás-os-Montes Zone* (GTMZ), which include the Cabo Ortegal Complex. Based on Simancas (2019).

In the geology of the Iberian peninsula, the Cabo Ortegal Complex forms part of the Iberian Massif, the largest domain of pre-Mesozoic rocks in continental Europe (**Fig_geological-setting_b**), which defines an orogen-scale fold (_i.e._ orocline) with the foreland fold-and-thrust belt at its core. The internal zone of the belt corresponds in NW Iberia to the *Galicia-Trás-os-Montes Zone* (GTMZ; **Fig_geological-setting_c**), which include five allochthonous complexes (Cabo Ortegal, Malpica-Tuy and Órdenes in Spain, Bragança and Morais in Portugal). These complexes consist of various metamorphic units representing peri-Gondwanan terranes accreted to the Gondwanan margin during the Variscan collision.

The Cabo Ortegal Complex stands out in the Iberian Peninsula for preserving the most complete section and best outcrops of high-pressure (HP), high-temperature (HT) metamorphic rocks. It consists of two main tectonic units referred to as the Upper and Lower Tectonic Units (**Fig_map-Cabo-Ortegal**), distinguished by their metamorphic grade (Marcos et al., 2002; Arenas et al., 2014a). These units are mostly correlated with the subdivisions of the other allochthonous complexes of NW Iberia and some of the European Variscides (_e.g._, Martínez Catalán et al. 2020)

> NOTE: Are you thinking of keeping this version of the map and section or you have another one in mind (like the one in the 2019 chapter by Martinez-Catalan?). Potentially to be added a panel with a schematic map of the different complexes.

#### Lower Tectonic Unit

This unit comprises a suite of low- to high-pressure rocks without high-T imprints, interpreted as remnants of the subducted Gondwanan margin and arc-derived rocks of the peri-Gondwanan transitional crust, which were deformed and exhumed in a subduction channel. It is typically divided into three sub-units (_e.g._, Marcos et al., 2002; Arenas et al., 2014):

> NOTE: I thought subduction conduit was used instead of channel to specifically refer to the slowly moving, exhuming part of the system. I don't know much about this. Is it just a conceptual detail restrictied to Beaumont et al. (1999) or is there now some consensus on the use of channel/conduit?

1. **Ophiolitic Unit**. This unit mostly consists of monotonous amphibolites and Grt-bearing amphibolites of meta-gabbroic origin. They form the *Purrido* (Sánchez Martínez et al. 2011) and *Peña Escrita* amphibolites and the *Moeche* unit, which consists of greenschists with few metagabbroic inclusions (Arenas et al., 2014b). These rocks are interpreted as dismembered slices of ophiolitic units. Their regional significance is far more limited than that of better-preserved ophiolitic units in the other allochthonous complexes (particularly in Órdenes; Arenas, 2015), which allow for the discrimination of two main age groups: Cambro-Ordovician and Early Devonian ophiolites (Martínez-Catalán et al., 2019). The Cabo Ortegal occurrences belong to the latter group.

2. ***Somozas Mélange* Unit**. This unit is a 500-m-thick sheet of intensely deformed rocks with both continental (meta-igneous and meta-sedimentary blocks) and oceanic (close-packed and broken pillow breccias) affinities. It represents a tectonic, serpentinite-matrix mélange (Arenas et al. 2009, Novo-Fernández et al. 2016, and references therein).

3.  **Basal Unit**. Poorly exposed in the Cabo Ortegal Complex (*Espasante* formation), this unit consists of felsic orthogneisses, amphibolites and minor retro-eclogites. It represents parts of the distal Gondwanan margin which record HP metamorphism under low- to intermediate-temperature conditions.

#### Upper Tectonic Unit

This unit is the main focus of this excursion and is described in detail in **Section 3** and **4**. It consists of several strongly deformed rock units that have experienced high pressures (> 1.7 GPa) and high temperatures (> 700 ºC). It contains five main mappable rock types: (**1**) ultramafics peridotites and pyroxenites (and subordinate lithologies); (**2**) ultramafic cumulates (pyrigarnites, hornblendites); (**3**) Opx-free Grt granulites (mafic to felsic) and amphibolites; (**4**) eclogites and (**5**) quartzo-feldspathic gneisses, with variable degrees of retrogression. 

> NOTE: What about the IP unit (Cariño gneiss) in this nomenclature?

The eclogites are known as the *Concepenido* formation. The gneisses occur as the *Chímparra* gneiss to W, and as the *Cariño* and *Banded* gneiss formations to the E. The ultramafic cumulates and most of the granulites form together the *Bacariza* (or *Vacariza*) formation to the W, whereas the E granulite body is known as the *Candelaria* formation.

Some authors divide Upper Tectonic Unit into an intermediate pressure (IP) unit (*Cariño* gneiss) and an ensemble of high-pressure (HP) further divided based on the similarity of their lithological sequence but differing amphibolite facies overprint hindering earlier HP-HT history (_e.g._, Galán and Marcos, 2000):
- *La Capelada* (or *Concepenido-La Capelada*) Unit, which includes the ultramafic massifs, *Bacariza* granulites, *Concepenido* eclogites and the *Banded gneiss* formation;
- *Cedeira* Unit, which includes the *Chímparra* gneiss and the *Candelaria* formation.

In contrast to the Lower Tectonic Unit, the cartographic pattern of the Upper Tectonic Unit shows a consistent lithological sequence, interpreted by some authors as a continuous lithospheric section of lower crust and upper mantle (_e.g._, Marcos et al., 2002, Brown et al., 2009), while others separate the different mappable units by ductile thrusts (_e.g._, Abalos et al., 2003 and references therein).

## 3. The ultramafic massifs

### 3.1 Field aspect & petrography

Ultramafic rocks are mainly exposed in the *Herbeira* (12.5 km<sup>2</sup>), *Limo* (6.6 km<sup>2</sup>) and *Uzal* (3.6 km<sup>2</sup>) massifs (**Fig_HP-units-simplified**), but also in ~40 sparse harzburgitic outcrops within *Bacariza* granulites, interpreted by some authors as tectonic windows. The massifs are always in contact with granulites except on the W edge of the *Uzal* massif, where they are in tectonic contact with the *Chímparra* gneiss.

Minor ultramafic rocks occur along the shear zone (*Carreiro* shear zone) that represents the contact between the Upper and Lower Tectonic (Ophiolitic) unit (Azcárraga et al. 2002). Among them, mylonitic garnet (Grt)-facies harzburgites and olivine (Ol) orthopyroxenites have been interpreted as buried serpentinite indicating HP conditions up to 3 GPa (Gil Ibarguchi et al. 1999). These rocks are not further discussed here.

**Fig_HP-units-simplified**. Simplified map of the HP units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex showing the location of the ultramafic massifs (Tilhac et al. 2016, and references therein).

I would obviously only use it for the guide, it's just to add some information and adjust the outlines within Herbeira.

The ultramafic rocks are primarily composed of harzburgites which dominate in the *Limo* and *Uzal* massifs. In contrast, the *Herbeira* massif preserves a mucher great lithological diversity, including harzburgites, pyroxenites, dunites and chromitites.

#### Harzburgites

As in *Limo* and *Uzal*, harzburgites constitute a mantle tectonite in the E part of the *Herbeira* massif (**Fig_harzburgites**). These rocks are predominantly amphibole (Amp)- and chlorite (Chl)-bearing Spl-facies harzburgites with < 2 % clinopyroxene (Cpx), strongly serpentinized (up to 70 % in extreme cases).

style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1000px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_harzburgites**. **a.** Relatively fresh harzburgite outcrop at the bottom of the cliffs near the NW boundary of the *Herbeira* massif; note the strong foliation outlined by aligned Opx porphyroclasts and Chl-rich trails. **b.** Serpentinized harzburgite representative of inland exposures in the *Herbeira* and *Limo* massifs; **c.** Detail of bastitized Opx porphyroclasts and Chl in the matrix. **d.** Strongly serpentinized harzburgite and thin pyroxenites in an inland outcrop (Tilhac, 2017).

Harzburgites exhibit a porphyroclastic texture with 5-10mm orthopyroxene (Opx) porphyroblasts embedded in an Ol matrix (**Fig_harzburgites**). They contain up to 30  of Mg-hornblende and < 10 % of Spl occurring as < 5 mm grains. Spinel (Spl), Amp, and Chl, often associated with magnetite (Mag), define the schistosity.

> NOTE: Add a microphotograph of harzburgite here

Less voluminous peridotitic lithologies such as lherzolites and wehrlites occur sporadically. They are observed with diffuse contacts to pyroxenites in the pyroxenite-rich domain, in the mantle tectonite at the bottom of the *Herbeira cliffs* (**Fig_lherzolite-outcrop**) and associated with dunite and chromitites above the pyroxenite-rich domain. They were described as “impregnated” dunites and harzburgites by Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi (1991).

#### Pyroxenites

Pyroxenites are particularly abundant (80–90%) in a 3-km long, 300-m-thick domain (potentially consisting of one or several lenticular bodies) exposed in the W cliffs of the *Herbeira* massif (see **Section 6.1** and **Fig_map-Herbeira**). They generally occur interlayered with dunites or as massives outcrops with lateral extension of individual layers exceeding 100 m (Girardeau et al. 1989, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991). The Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites have been classified based on their field occurence as follows (**Fig_pyroxenites**; Tilhac et al. 2016, Tilhac 2017): 

- *Type 1*. Ol-clinopyroxenites and websterite, occurring as branching layers preserving dunite lenses;
- *Type 2*. Massive websterites forming thick layers (up to 3 m);
- *Type 3*. Thinly foliated, amphibolitized pyroxenites;
- *Type 4*. Subordinate Opx-rich websterites and orthopyroxenites, often outcropping near chromitites.

**Fig_pyroxenites**. Representrative outcrops of the different types of pyroxenites in the *Herbeira* massif (Tilhac, 2017).

Representative modal compositions are approx. 30–80 % Cpx, 0–45 % Opx, 5-40 % Amp, 2–8 % Spl, 6–7 % Grt when present, < 1 % base-metal sulfides and 1-2 % Chl when present. Olivine is mostly restricted to type-1 and -4 pyroxenites. Cpx/Opx ratios decrease from type-1 and-3 pyroxenites through type-2 to type-4 pyroxenites (**Fig_pyroxenites-mode**). Amphibole is most abundant in type-3 pyroxenites and least abundant in type-1 pyroxenites.

**Fig_pyroxenites-mode**. Modal compositions of the different types of pyroxenites in Cabo Ortegal. Thin layers (< 5-cm thick) are indicated as their modal composition may be strongly affected by mechanical mixing with the host peridotites (Tilhac et al. 2016).

> NOTE: Ideally I would also add a representative range for the Cabo Ortegal peridotites. Potentially also add a panel with  WR compositions here.

Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites have medium- to coarse-grained granoblastic to porphyroclastic textures. Pyroxenes (Cr-diopside and enstatite) occur as 1-5 mm exsolved porphyroclasts with complex boundaries and as 50–800 μm exsolution-free neoblasts. Olivine either occurs as relatively fresh dunitic lenses, as interstitial trails associated with Spl and Amp, or as inclusions in pyroxene (Px). Spinel is found as rounded enclosed grains and large (rarely idiomorphic) interstitial grains, associated with sulfides. It is also observed as part of a mesh of exsolved needles associated with Px and Amp. This mesh commonly  delineate curved-shaped domains with Px porphyroclasts leaving exsolution-free rims and halos around Spl grains(**Fig_subsolidus-assemblages**). Garnet occurs only in some massive websterites (type 2), either in equilibrium with Px, as coronas around Spl (**Fig_subsolidus-assemblages_a**) or with symplectites of Spl and pyroxenes (± Amp, Ilm).

> NOTE: Add microphotograph of HT assemblages in pyroxenites here

Amphibole occurs either as pre- to syn-kinematic xenomorphic grains in textural equilibrium with Cpx (Amp I) or more commonly as clearly post-kinematic (_i.e._ internally undeformed), replacing Cpx (± Spl) among matrix minerals, often as idiomorphic crystals (**Fig_subsolidus-assemblages_b**). It is locally associated with vermicular Spl and replacing Px exsolution lamellae. These two textural generations, confirmed by electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) data, are respectively interpreted as evidence of late-magmatic crystallization of residual melts (Amp I) and of hydration and retrograde metamorphism (Amp II). Extreme cases of amphibolitization produce hornblendites with poikilitic textures.

Note the Spl exsolution mesh restricted to parts of Px porphyroclasts and vermicular Spl associated with Amp (sample CO-006-A; Tilhac et al. 2016)

> NOTE: Add images of symplectite + EDS map of Grt corona. Also highlight the two generations of Amp. Adjust panel order accordingly.

Accessory Chl occurs often associated with Spl after or in textural equilibrium with Amp. Base-metal sulfides are relatively fresh (< 20 % of alteration products such as Fe oxyhydrodrides) and occur as either rounded homogeneous inclusions in silicates or more commonly large interstitial grains exsolving pyrrhotite (Po), pentlandite (Pn) and chalcopyrite (Ccp), particularly when associated with Amp. Rare platinum-group minerals (PGM) have been found, mainly Pt– Pd-rich tellurides, bismuthides and arsenides, hosted as needles in sulfides (Tilhac et al. 2016, Tilhac 2017).

> NOTE: Add sulfide images from Tilhac et al. (2020) + PGM

#### Dunites & chromitites

In the *Herbeira* massif, dunites outcrop alternately with pyroxenites and chromitites or as massive outcrops (**Fig_chromitites**). It is the most common lithology above (_i.e._ upper dunite of Moreno et al. 2001), and to a lesser extent, below (_i.e._ lower dunite) the pyroxenite-rich area (see **Fig_map-Herbeira**). Transition to the pyroxenite-rich area is gradational, showing a downward and upward decrease in the frequency of distinctively weathering pyroxenite layers. In massive dunite outcrops, thin, partially "dissolved"pyroxenite layers suggest that a generation of pyroxenites pre-dates dunitization (**Fig_dissolved-pyroxenite**). Dunite occurs less commonly as decameter-size pods with diffuse contacts within harzburgites (Santos et al. 2002), notably associated with chromitites at the beach level in the *Herbeira* cliffs (Moreno et al. 2001).

**Fig_dissolved-pyroxenite**. Chromite precipitated _via_ incongruent melting or dissolution of pyroxenes at the termination of a pre-existing pyroxenite layer in the lower dunite near *Punta Robaliceira* (Tilhac, 2017).

Despite being foliated, Cabo Ortegal dunites are less deformed and serpentinized than the harzburgites. Both the upper and lower dunites exhibit serpentinized mm-size Ol porphyroclasts and small neoblasts. Sporadic Opx and large (> 3 mm) Cpx grains occur interstitially, as well as Amp, Chl and locally Phl. A variety of accessory minerals has been reported (Monterrubio Pérez 1991, Monterrubio Pérez et al. 1992), including Mag, Pn, Ccp, Po and heazlewoodite (Hzl). 

> NOTE: Add microphotograph of dunite

> NOTE: There is this paper by Pereira et al. (2008) on Cabo Ortegal serpentinites that claims dunites is the most serpentinized lithology (>90 %), more than harzburgites... What do you think?

Chromian Spl occurs as elongated grains outlining the foliation. In the lower dunite, it is restricted to disseminated grains and rare, thin chromitite layers. In the upper dunite, it is much more abundant and occurs concentrated in pods, lenses or layers > 10-cm thick (Monterrubio Pérez et al., 1992) and irregular concentrations (schlieren) up to 50-cm thick (Moreno 1999, Moreno et al. 2001).

**Fig_chromitites**. **a & b**. Massive (type-I) chromitites in the upper dunite, near on the edge of the *Herbeira* cliffs, where most of the chromitites are observed. **c & d.** Semi-massive (type-II) chromitites associated with pyroxenite in different locations of the *Herbeira* massif (Tilhac, 2017).

Chromitite occurences in the upper dunite have been classified as follows (García-Tudela et al. 2024):

- *Type-I*. Massive (> 80 % Chr) chromitites with coarse (>500 μm) Chr grains;
- *Type-II*. Semi-massive (< 80 % Chr) chromitites with smaller and more altered modular Chr grains and pull-apart texture.

In chromitites, Chr grains occur in a matrix of serpentine (Srp) and Chl. They may exhibit thin Fe-rich alteration rims and inclusions of Cpx, Amp, sulfides (mainly Pn and Ccp) and PGM (near grain boundaries in type II), as well as Chl and locally Ap in type-I and Ol in type-II chromitites. Detailed study of the PGM revealed a remarkably diversity of primary and secondary platinum-group sulphides, alloys, arsenides and other minerals (Moreno et al. 1999).

> NOTE: Add microphotograph of chromitite/PGM

#### Other rocks

Mafic rocks occur as a 3–5 m thick outcrop near the top of the pyroxenite-rich domain, parallel to the main foliation (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991). It exhibits 5-20-cm granoblastic layers of Grt, Zo and minor Cpx, alternating with layers rich in Amp ± Zo or Spl. Kyanite (Ky) inclusions in Zo and Spl and corundum (Crn) inclusions in Grt have been reported (Santos et al. 2002). K-feldspar (Kfs) and plagioclase (Plg) are rare accessory minerals. A gradual transition is observed between these rocks and Grt clinopyroxenite with Rt partly replaced by titanite (Ttn) and minor Ilm. These lithologies originally described as a gabbroic facies by Girardeau et al. (1989) are most likely unrelated to the main pyroxenites (see **Section 3.2**). 

Other lithologies include pyroxenite and Grt-rich dykes injected in C’-like tensional fractures (Girardeau et al. 1990, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991), which commonly occur cross-cutting the compositional layering at a high angle (>30°) in the pyroxenite-rich domain (**Fig_pyroxenite-dykes**). These dykes are only deformed in mylonitic bands near the contacts with underlying granulites (see **Stop 7**), sealed in turn by undeformed pyroxenite dykes injected in Riedel fractures (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991), particularly abundant in the upper dunite.

### 3.2 Protolith interpretations

#### Brief historical review

*1960-70s: lherzolitic mantle diapirs*

The Cabo Ortegal Complex was originally in the  studied by a group of Dutch researchers who published a series of very comprehensive articles describing the geology and petrology of the different units (Vogel, 1967, Maaskant, 1970, Engels, 1972, Den Tex et al. 1972), as well as the earliest geochemical and isotopic studies of the complex (Van Calsteren, 1978, 1979), mostly in the journal edited by Leiden University *Leidse Geologische Mededelinge*. The multiphase tectonothermal history of the HP units was recognized early on as a significant impediment to understanding the origin of the ultramafic massifs:

*« Speculations about the origin of the ultrabasites are doomed to be fruitless in view of the various geological processes to which these rocks have been subjected. »* (Vogel, 1967)

The protoliths of Cabo Ortegal peridotites were first inferred to be a lherzolite where Cpx has been replaced by hornblende (Masskant, 1970). Their emplacement was ascribed to one or several diapirs segregated from a mantle plume either along an oceanic geotherm (Maaskantt 1970) or into the continental crust, thus responsible for granulites-facies metamorphism of originally eclogitic lower crust (Van Calsteren et al. 1977). The different pyroxenites were regarded as _in-situ_ partial melting products of the lherzolite.

*1980-90s: heterogeneity of the upper mantle.*

More work was carried out in the 1980s and 1990s by Spanish and French collaborations (Arenas et al., 1986; Bernard-Griffiths et al, 1985; Gil Ibarguchi et al., 1990, Peucat et al., 1990), notably focusing on the ultramafic massifs (_e.g._, Girardeau et al. 1989; Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi 1991. Several PhD theses on the ultramafics came from these and other groups (Ben Jamaa, 1988, Monterrubio Pérez 1991, Laribi-Halimi 1992, Gravestock, 1992, Moreno 1999). 

From then on, the peridotite protoliths were considered as a Spl-harzburgite (ascribing part of the amphibolitization to near-isochemical retrograde hydration). They were interpreted as a residual oceanic mantle owing to its depleted mineral chemistry (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, Laribi-Halimi, 1992), potentially representing imbricated tectonic slices of a subducted slab (Gil Ibarguchi et al. 1990). However, relatively low ε<sub>Nd</sub> (~ +4) measured in a harzburgite compared to the N-MORB-like eclogites with ε<sub>Nd</sub> (~ +10) and the occurrence of hundreds of meters of pyroxenite were problematic in such an oceanic setting (Ben Jamaa, 1988). A sub-continental influence and back-arc setting were thus envisaged (Peucat et al. 1990). In this context, the intrusion of external melt reacting with the ambient peridotite was recognized as a more reasonable scenario to explain the observed amount of pyroxenites (Girardeau et al. 1989, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, Gravestock, 1992).

*2000s: lower-crustal arc-root cumulate* 

The layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association exposed in the *Herbeira* cliffs was interpreted by Moreno et al. (2001) as the magmatic stratigraphy of a lower-crustal cumulate in an arc root, based on increasing platinum-group element (PGE) contents (_i.e._ from the PGE-poor lower dunite to the PGE-rich upper dunite) and progressive PGE fractionation towards Pd-Pt enrichment (**Fig_PGE**) in the chromitites.

**Fig_PGE**. **a.** Sketch depicting the stratigraphic interpretation of the W part of the *Herbeira* massif as a lower-crustal cumulate sequence based on increasing PGE enrichment and fractionation (Moreno et al. 2001). Representative PGE distributions (chondrite-normalized) are shown along with the highest concentration obtained at each location. **b.** Map showing the corresponding chromitite sample locations; note the location of the suggested Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF; see **Stop 7**). Location 2 corresponds to chromitite-bearing dunite pods in harzburgite (Moreno et al. 2001).

This arc-related interpretation provides a better explanation to the residual character of the harzburgites which was confirmed by Santos et al. (2002) based on mantle-array-like Ol chemistry (_i.e._ ~0.4 % NiO, Fo90). These authors also identified a fractional crystallization trend of decreasing NiO and Fo in Ol between the pyroxenites and dunites (see **fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**), who considered the lithological heterogeneity of the *Herbeira* massif as derived from a mantle wedge modified by slab-derived fluids or melts.

#### Petrogenetic model of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites

Following on the original work by Girardeau and coworkers, the ultramafic massifs were recently re-investigated as part of two PhD theses (Tilhac 2017, Henry 2018). A more comprehensive petrogenetic model combining magmatic differentiation and melt-peridotite interaction (**Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**) was formulated based on the classification of the pyroxenite subtypes and more recent geochemical data (Tilhac et al. 2016, 2017, 2020). In this classification, the strongly foliated and amphibolitized (type-3) pyroxenites clearly require a deformational, metamorphic and metasomatic overprint. Accordingly, the petrogenesis of type-3 pyroxenites will be specifically discussed as part of the tectonothermal evolution of the massifs (**Section 5**) and in the description of **Stop 3.3**.

The petrogenetic model proposed by Tilhac (2017) involves the intrusion into a lithospheric arc root of a primitive Si-undersaturated melt, interacting with the host harzburgites to produce dunites and chromitites, as well as Ol-bearing, Cpx-rich pyroxenites (type 1), which represent incomplete replacement products of the peridotites (**Fig-petrogenetic_model**). Massive Ol-free websterites (type 2) either represent more differentiated products of this process and/or cumulates of a distinct, Si-saturated melt (Tilhac et al. 2016).

**Fig-petrogenetic-model**. Schematic representation of the model proposed by Tilhac (2017) for the main magmatic episode in the petrogenesis of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites, dunites and chromitites, assuming an initially Si-undersaturated (**a**) and/or Si-saturated (**b**) melt. Note that the spatial association of chromitites and type-4 pyroxenites had not been identified by Tilhac (2017) and is thus not reflected here).

In this model, whether type-1 and type-2 pyroxenites are cogenetic was left as an open question although two scenarios involving different parental melts were proposed.
- Evidence in favour of their cogeneticity (**Fig_petrogenetic-model_a**) includes relatively homogeneous radiogenic isotope compositions consistent with a single batch of parental melt (_e.g_ Gravestock 1992, Santos et al., 2002, Tilhac et al. 2017). Mineral chemistry also suggests that the pyroxenites can be related to the same melt differentation/melt-rock interaction trend (_e.g._, **Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites_b**). However, the high Mg# and Cr# of the Opx-rich (type-4) pyroxenites is not well accounted for in this case.
- Evidence against their cogeneticity (**Fig_petrogenetic-model_b**) consists of field observations on the large outcrop surfaces exposed on the shore at the bottom of the *Herbeira* cliffs. Massive (type-2) pyroxenites are seen as thick and layers, relatively undeformed compared to type-1 and -3 pyroxenites (**Fig-pyroxenites-cliff**), which cannot be fully accounted for by deformation localization away from thick (more competent) pyroxenite layers. In addition, the high Mg# and Cr# of type-4 pyroxenites and their field occurrence associated with chromitites point to a very primitive character, suggesting that they are more likely to be related to type-2 pyroxenites (see **Stop 4.2**), implying that type-1 and type-2/-4 pyroxenites relate to distinct (overlapping) differentation trends.

**Fig-pyroxenites-cliff**. Outcrop on the shoreline at the bottom of the *Herbeira* cliffs exposing field relationships between different types of pyroxenites (Tilhac, 2017). (**a.**) Overview of the outcrop highlighting the massive field occurrence of type-2 pyroxenites contrasting with branching type-1 pyroxenites in the upper part of the outcrop (**b.**) Detail view of strongly deformed pyroxenite-dunite association showing foliated type-3 pyroxenites and shear zones associated with late pyroxenite dykes.

Based on the considerations above, the latter scenario is here preferred with two subsequent melt intrusions as summarized below:
1. A Si-undersaturated melt led to the formation of dunites and branching veins of replacive Ol clinopyroxenites (type 1) preserving dunite lenses. 
2. A more Si-rich melt led to the formation of primitive orthopyroxenites (type-4) and more evolved, massive websterites.

In this scenario, chromitites are most likely associated with stage 2. Type-4 pyroxenites are indeed mostly observed near chromitites. However, it cannot be excluded that chromitites were also formed during stage 1. Similarly,  some websterites (type 2) may have formed at higher melt/rock ratios during stage 1. 

Lastly, the observation of thin pyroxenite layers "dissolved" in dunite was interpreted by Tilhac (2017) as evidence for the existence of an older generation of pyroxenites pre-dating all the main types(**Fig-dissolved-pyroxenite**). In the preferred scenario above, these may simply represent type-1 pyroxenites affected by some stage-2 dunitization. This alternative depends on the uncertain extent of Ol fractionation and melt–rock interaction of the more Si-rich, stage-2 melt (Tilhac et al. 2016)

#### Parental melts and source constraints

Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites have markedly higher SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaO, Cr and Sc contents and lower Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub> and Ni contents than pyroxenites from most ultramafic massifs (_e.g._, Horoman, Ronda, Beni Boussera, Lanzo, Lherz). High concentrations of compatible elements (_e.g._, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> >0.4%) suggest that they crystallized from primitive melts. The pyroxenites are also characterised by low-Al pyroxenes indicating low Al/Si parental melts such as boninites or high-Mg# andesites. Very high CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> more specifically suggests high-Ca boninites or ultra-calcic picrites. 

Assuming a two-stage scenario, as discussed above, the high Cpx/Opx ratios of type-1 pyroxenites suggest the early appearance of Cpx and a crystallization along a Cpx–Ol cotectic line, which is specifically expected from ultra-calcic picrites (**Fig_normative-compositions**). In contrast, type-2 websterites exhibit a bonitic affinity comparable with experimental pyroxenitic cumulates of hydrous basaltic andesite and high-Mg# andesite at 1.2 GPa (Müntener et al. 2001). The inferred crystallization sequence of Ol (+Cr-Spl) > Opx > Cpx speficically point to low-Ca boninite (Crawford et al. 1989).

In the alternative scenario envisaged by Tilhac (2017) whereby type-2 and type-1 pyroxenites can be cogenetic, the ultra-calcic picrite would be parental to a more evolved boninite. These considerations are out of the scope of this field guide but relate to an ongoing debate on the primary nature of arc magmas, and bonitites in particular (_e.g._, Cooper et al. 2010, Bénard et al. 2016, and references therein).

Light grey and dark grey arrows correspond to the potential differentiation trends for type-1 pyroxenites and type-2 pyroxenites, towards picrites and boninites, respectively. Ultra-calcic picrites are ankaramitic lavas from Vanuatu (Barsdell & Berry, 1990). High-Ca boninites are lavas from Tonga and the Troodos ophiolite (Crawford et al., 1989).

> NOTE: Adust to make it consistent with the revised scenario.

The parental melts invoked are compatible with the conclusion from Moreno et al. (2001) that the chromitites crystallized from a S-poor, mantle-derived melt. Indeed, the abundance of sulfides (up 1 %) cannot be accounted for by the low S contents of boninitic or picritic melts, which must at least partly relate to a secondary S addition (Tilhac et al. 2020), as suggested by the textural association between interstitial sulfides and Amp (_e.g._, Tilhac et al. 2016, and references therein). 

Empirical calculations based on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> contents in chromitites yield two parental melt compositions comparable to a fore-arc (_i.e._ low-Ti) basalt and a boninite for type-I and -II chromitites, respectively (García-Tudela et al. 2024). This result could relate to the existence of two distinct parental melts as in the two-stage scenario discussed above. However, it relies on the assumption that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> contents in Chr are primary compositions. The observed differences between the two chromitite groups are indeed relatively small and could simply owe to subsolidus re-equilibration (_e.g._, Pagé & Barnes 2009; Tilhac, 2017).

An important constraint on the source region of the different melts involved in the petrogenesis of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites, dunites and chromitites comes from the geochemical signature shared by the different pyroxenite subtypes. They all exhibit high CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, low TiO<sub>2</sub> and alkalis, and selective large ion lithophile (LILE)/high field strength elements (HFSE) enrichment. These characteristics suggest a depleted, low Cpx/Opx (_i.e._ harzburgitic) mantle, metasomatized by slab- or mantle-wedge derived hydrous fluids or silicate melts (Tilhac et al. 2016) or carbonatites (Gravestock, 1992). Within this source, the genesis of picritic to boninitic primary melts can be ascribed to the nature and proportion of metasomatic agent and/or different melting lithologies (_e.g._, Schmidt et al. 2004).

> NOTE: Perhaps a spyder diagram to show the LILE/HFSE enrichment here.

In contrast, the subordinate mafic rocks (and related pyroxenites) are systematically Al- and Ti-rich, which clearly indicate that they are unrelated to the main pyroxenites. These mafic rocks also exhibit positive Eu, Sr and Ba anomalies and high alkali contents suggesting the former presence of Plg (Santos et al. 2002). 

### 3.3 Thermobarometric estimates

The occurrence of Grt as relatively undeformed coronas around Spl in the main pyroxenites is indicative of syn- to post-kinematic prograde metamorphism. Peak conditions under eclogite-facies conditions have been calculated at 1.6-1.8 GPa and 780-800 °C (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, Tilhac et al. 2016). Similar conditions are recorded by the late pyroxenite and Grt-rich dykes (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991) which were probably intruded near peak conditions.

Amphibolitization of the peridotites and pyroxenites suggests an episode of retrograde metamorphism (and hydration). Corresponding P-T conditions have not been calculated in the ultramafic massifs, but probably correspond to amphibolite-facies conditions (~0.8 GPa, 500°C; Abalos et al. 2003) documented in other HP units of the complex, although unpublished calculations based on Amp compositions yield lower pressure (~0.4 GPa).

### 3.4 Age constraints

As in the other HP units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex, two main age clusters have been identified in the ultramafic massifs. 

#### Middle Devonian age cluster

A first cluster at ~ 390 Ma is particularly well documented by zircon (Zrn) and rutile (Rt) U-Pb ages of 383-392 Ma, notably in a Grt clinopyroxenite vein in the *Uzal* massif (Peucat et al. 1990, Santos Zalduegui et al. 1996, Ordóñez Casado et al. 2001). It overlaps with Rb-Sr and K-Ar ages of 386-401 Ma obtained from a 150-m drilled core (one of the six boreholes drilled by *Chartered Exploraciones*) in the *Herbeira* peridotites (Van Calsteren et al. 1979, Kuijper et al. 1982) and a U-Pb isochron age of 400 ± 26 Ma reported for the peridotites, pyroxenites and Grt-bearing mafic rocks. The latter also yielded Sm-Nd isochron ages of 392-394 Ma (Santos et al. 2002).

This cluster is coeval with the HP-HT metamorphic event documented by U-Pb and <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar ages of 382-395 Ma in the adjacent HP units (Santos Zalduegui et al. 1996, Ordóñez Casado et al. 2001, Gómez Barreiro et al. 2007), associated with a well documented Devonian subduction. In the ultramafic massifs, it also dates the peak of HP metamorphism as well as the formation of cross-cutting pyroxenite veins and other intrusive bodies. Among them, a pegmatitic granite intruded into the *Uzal* peridotite provide a minimum age for the ultramafic massifs at 387-388 Ma (Santos Zalduegui et al. 1996)

#### Cambro-Ordovician age cluster

A second age cluster at ~ 500 Ma was first recognized by Rb-Sr ages of 477 ± 122 Ma for the *Herbeira* peridotites (Van Calsteren et al. 1979) and Sm-Nd ages of 493-506 Ma for the pyroxenites (Santos et al. 2002). It was recently confirmed by Sm–Nd ages of 459–515 Ma (Tilhac et al. 2017), including an external isochron at 474 ± 59 Ma defined by the variously LREE-enriched pyroxenite subtypes (see **Stops 2** and **3**). The latter remarkably coincides with an isochron age of 459 ± 84 Ma calculated for an increasingly LREE-enriched sample (CO-010; **Fig_CO-010**), whose enrichment probably relates to the percolation of residual websteritic melts, as discussed in **Section 3.2**. 

This cluster is comparable to U-Pb zircon ages of 480-520 Ma reported in other HP units and interpreted as related to the formation of most of the granulites and eclogite protoliths in a Cambrian oceanic domain and Ordovocian arc, respectively (Peucat et al. 1990, Ordóñez Casado et al. 1996, 2001). Tilhac et al. (2017) interpreted these ages in the ultramafic as representing minimum estimates, owing to the potential partial reset of the Sm-Nd system associated with amphibolitization. Second-stage Nd model ages of 502–762 Ma indeed suggest that some of Cabo Ortegal peridotites and pyroxenites could be older than 500 Ma (Tilhac et al. 2017). This is consistent with the Re-depletion model age (τ<sub>RD</sub>) of 588 Ma obtained for a harzburgite. A Re-Os isochron age at 838 ± 42 Ma was also obtained from the samples most preserved from Re addition associated with amphibolitization and supergene alteration (Tilhac et al. 2020), which preferentially affected low-Mg#, low-Cu/S pyroxenites.

## 4. Other HP units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex

### 4.1 Granulites

#### Field aspect & petrography

Granulites outcrop as the *Bacariza* formation between the *Concepenido* eclogites to the E and the ultramafic massifs to the W (**Fig_map-complex**), although most geological maps also show granulites directly in contact with high-pressure paragneisses in the southern part of the complex. The contacts between the granulites and the ultramafic massifs have been described as either ductile thrusts (Abalos et al. 1996, Azcárraga et al. 2002, Ábalos et al. 2003, Puelles et al. 2005) or non-tectonic lithological conformities, thus potentially representing a crust-mantle transition (Galán & Marcos, 1997, Galán & Marcos, 2000, Marcos et al. 2002). The granulites are characterised by the lack of Opx and a high Grt content, with very variable Cpx, Amp and Plg contents. The *Bacariza* formation also includes utramafic cumulates (pyrigarnites, hornblendites) that occur along the contact with the *Uzal* peridotite massif to the W and with the layered Opx-free granulites to the E. They occur as a continuous layer of Si-poor, Fe- and Ti-rich rocks with Cpx, Grt and Amp (pargasite) in varying proportions. Ultramafic occurrences are also found embedded in the main granulites forming elongated lenses parallel to the tectonic layering. In the nearby *Candelaria* amphibolites formation, Opx-free Grt granulites occur with higher Amp content compared to *Bacariza* granulites. They also contain Fe-Ti-rich ultramafic rocks, notably near *Monte Agüdo*, (**Fig_map-complex**) where they are surrounded by the Opx-free Amp-rich granulites and a tectonic contact to the S, so their overlying unit is not observed. On most maps, *Candelaria* amphibolites are in contact with high-pressure paragneisses and other low-pressure units along tectonic contacts.

> NOTE: I am not sure whether you meant to refer to the main map of the complex here, or to another map more sepcific to the granulites.

Cabo Ortegal granulites are mostly mafic to felsic opx-free garnet granulites. They exhibit a broad compositional variation, with different facies distinguished by various authors. Apart from volumetrically minor and exotic types (leptynitic gneisses, calcite-rich granulites, and Mg-rich granulites (Galán and Marcos, 2000), we here consolidate five main types below based on their silica content, ranging from ultramafic to acidic compositions:

> NOTE: Add Fig_granulite-facies

> NOTE: Add Fig_cumulates-in-carbonates?

- *Ultramafic Fe-Ti cumulates*. These Si-poor rocks are coarse- to medium-grained bi- or tri-mineralic (Grt-Cpx-Prg) when fresh, with Pl+Qtz content < 5%. They range all the way from pyrigarnites composed mainly of Cpx-Grt, to hornblendite composed mainly of Amp.

> NOTE: Add Fig_cumulates-arclogites.

- *Grt-rich mafic granulites*. These rocks are coarse-to medium-grained with > 5 % Amp. It is the dominant granulite facies, commonly referred to as layered granulites due to the strong layering produced by the contrast between mafic and Plg-rich layers. Cpx vary from augite to omphacite, and amphiboles from pargasite to pargasitic hornblende.

> NOTE: Add Fig_mafic-granulites.

- *Grt-rich amphibolites*. These rocks are also coarse- to medium-grained layered granulites but almost Cpx-free. They occur with intermediate rocks that occasionally show evidence of partial melting.

- *Grt-bearing trondhjemitic gneisses*: These acidic rocks are volumetrically less abundant but not rare. They are observed crystallised _in situ_ or as centimetre-wide veins cutting through the layering where partial melting is observed in mafic and intermediate granulites.

- *High-pressure migmatitic gneisses*: Also referred to as granulitic orthogneiss, these mafic to intermediate composition rocks outcrop between the *Limo* and *Herbeira* ultramafic massifs (**Fig_map-complex**).

#### Protolith interpretations

Various origins  have been proposed for these rocks, including: (1) residues of deep anatexis (Drury, 1980), (2) upper crust of a volcanic arc close to a continental margin or continental tholeiites (Peucat et al. 1990), (3) fractionation of melt crystals derived from a primitive mantle source (Gravestock 1992), or (4) a stratiform gabbroic complex at the base of continental crust (Galán and Marcos 1997). Although there is no consensus all interpretations so far suggest a sub-continental or arc-related tectonic environment.

#### Thermobarometric estimates

The maximum pressure has been established in the high-pressure migmatites to be between 1.9-2.3 GPa at temperatures between 815-865 °C (Beranoaguirre et al. 2020). These pressures are equivalent to those reached in the *Concepenido* eclogites, but at relatively higher temperatures. Mafic granulites provide peak conditions of 1.6-2.0 GPa and 740-950 °C depending on the method (Gil Ibarguchi et al. 1990, 2000; Galán and Marcos, 2000; Puelles et al. 2005; Spránitz et al. 2023). Ultramafic cummulates provided peak conditions of 1.7 GPa and 800 °C (Gil Ibarguchi et al. 1991).

#### Age constraints

U-Pb geochronology (zircon, titanite, rutile) provides two age groups. The main one gives ages of 372-392 Ma and is interpreted as the peak of HP metamorphism closely followed by partial melting events. Migmatization of the granulites is dated by U/Pb on zircons from a leucosome pod at 397-390 Ma (Fernández-Suárez et al. 2007). The other cluster gives ages between 459-497 Ma, interpreted by most authors as the age of the magmatic protoliths, although it could refer to an early metamorphic event (Fernández-Suárez et al. 2002).

### 4.2 Eclogites 

#### Field aspect & petrography 

Cabo Ortegal eclogites form a continuous band of about 20 km long, the *Concepenido* formation, among the longest eclogite outcrop in the world (Ábalos, 1997) with a minimum thickness of 100 m (mostly 500-700 m). They are sandwiched between Opx-free garnet granulites to the W and high-pressure paragneises to the E, with which they are partly associated (**Fig_map-complex**).

Fresh eclogite samples have 40-55% Omp, 25-35% Grt, 2-10% Qtz, ≤ 10% Zo, 4-7% Amp, 1-3% Rt and ≤ 1% Ph. Locally, Grt​ can dominate (up to 85%) forming garnet-rich centimetric bands. Most eclogites are however Zo-Amp eclogites and Amph eclogites. Three types are distinguished (Mendia, 1996):

- *Common (_i.e._ volumetrically dominant) eclogites*. This facies varies from massive (lacking lineation and exhibiting weak foliation) to strongly deformed (mylonitic LS-tectonites). Garnets typically range from 1 to 3 mm in size, but can exceptionally exceed 2 cm.

- *Ky-bearing eclogites*. These are strongly deformed Ky-bearing, lighter-coloured eclogites that contain garnets and clinopyroxenes ranging from several millimetres to centimetres (exceptionally up to 6 cm).

- *Ferrotitaniferous eclogites*. These make less than 5% of the total volume and differ from common eclogites only in their richer Fe-Ti compositions.

Eclogites show tight km-scale folds inferred from geological mapping (also visible in some cases on a scale of hundreds of metres). Hand samples range from massive to LS-type mylonites in bands of tens of centimeters. These mylonites are usually enriched in Zo and Amp relative to their precursor, indicating wet HP-HT deformation.

#### Protolith interpretations

This formation is interpreted as a metamorphosed piece of oceanic crust (N-MORB-like diabasic dykes and gabbros), potentially affected by significant continental contamination (Gravestock, 1992), but the existence of felsic rocks generated during decompressive partial melting complicates the distinction of former lithologies and compositions (Albert et al. 2012).

#### Thermobarometric estimates

Eclogite conditions peaked at ~1.7-2.3 GPa with a thermal maximum between 770-800 °C (Mendia 2000, Mendia et al. 2001) in both common and Ky-bearing eclogites. Lowest P-T conditions during retrogression record amphibolitisation and Pl-in at ~600 °C and 1.2-1.6 GPa (Mendia, 2000).

#### Age constraints

Zircon U-Pb dating in eclogites reveals an age cluster at around 390 Ma, interpreted as the time of eclogitization. Older ages between 495 and 470 Ma are interpreted as ages of the mafic protoliths for the common and Ky-bearing eclogites.

### 4.3 High-pressure gneisses

#### Field aspect & petrography

High-pressure gneisses occur as two mappable units: the *Banded* and the *Chímparra* gneisses. Depending on the authors, these two units are interpreted either as distinct or as the same formation on geological maps. Here, we considered them together. Both units are indeed mainly composed of strongly deformed Grt and Ky-bearing quartzo-feldspathic gneisses that include lenses of retrogressed eclogites, Grt pyroxenites and granulites. They also both feature evidence of partial melting and are strongly deformed. The *Banded gneiss* differs in including tonalitic orthogneisses and rare occurrences of coronitic metagabbros.

#### Protolith interpretations

The *Chímparra gneiss* is interpreted as originating from pelitic and semi-pelitic (graywackes) sediments with minor calc-silicate and mafic inclusions (Fernández, 1994), while the *Banded gneiss* protoliths are interpreted as a shallow crustal volcano-sedimentary sequence intruded punctually by igneous bodies (Albert, 2017).

The *Banded gneiss* formation is interpreted as metasedimentary gneisses with abundant mafic and rare ultramafic inclusions (Vogel, 1967, Gil Ibarguchi et al. 1990), representing a shallow pelitic and greywacke volcano-sedimentary sequence (Albert, 2017), intruded punctually by igneous mafic bodies (now eclogites) and minor granites and tonalities (now orthogneisses). The gabbroic melts were variously differentiated from homogeneous tholeiitic parental melts (Bernard-Griffiths et al. 1985, Peucat et al. 1990).

#### Thermobarometric estimates

The *Chímparra* gneiss yields a metamorphic peak at 1.5-1.7 GPa and 800-900 °C (Fernández, 1994; Fernández and Marcos, 1997).

#### Age constraints

Zircon provenance studies indicate that the sediments must be younger than 515 ± 15 Ma. Felsic dykes intruded into the *Banded gneiss* yield concordant Zrn and Mnz U-Pb dates of 475-485 Ma, interpreted as the age of the dyke intrusion into the sediments (Fernández et al. 2016). Accordingly, the paragneisses represent middle to late Cambrian sediments. On the other hand, U-Pb ages on zircon, monazite and rutile in leucosomes date the sediments migmatisation at 394-382 Ma, coinciding with U-Pb zircon ages in the eclogite lenses (393 Ma) and the orthogneiss (395 Ma) hosted in the *Banded gneiss*.

## 5 Tectonic summary
 
We attempt below to provide a brief summary of the origin and evolution of the ultramafic massifs that takes into account field observations, tectono-thermal and geochronological constraints consolidated from the different HP units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex.

### 5.1 Magmatic history: a peri-Gondwanan volcanic arc

Many lines of evidence indicate that the ultramafic massifs record magmatic activity in a subduction-related environment. The layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association of the *Herbeira* massif more specifically point to the intrusion of two batches of primitive picritic/boninitic melts in a lithospheric arc root (Moreno et al. 2001, Tilhac et al. 2016). Accordingly, a continental volcanic arc setting was suggested for the granulite protoliths (Peucat et al. 1990) and the occurrence of ultramafic cumulates comparable to arclogites is also compatible with this interpretation. Such a lithological sequence is indeed observed in the deep sections of young and modern arc (Ducea et al. 2021, and references therein).

> NOTE: Your Harker diagram would nicely fit here to illustrate this. By the way, I was wondering how to explain the fact that the ultamafic cumulates only occur in contact with Uzal but then I checked agin Sergio's and Brown et al. papers where "eclogites sensu lato" are mapped also along the E boundaries of Limo and Herbeira, similarly to the pyrigarnite next to Uzal? What do you think about this?

In the nearby Bragança Complex in Portugal, an arc environment was proposed for the origin of the chromitites  (Bridges et al. 1995). Many lithological features of the *Herbeira* massif are similar to the Jijal ultramafic section of the famous Kohistan arc complex in Pakistan, where pyroxenites preserving dunite lenses have also been interpreted as partial replacement of peridotite (Burg et al., 1998; Garrido et al., 2007). Accordinglty, the chromitites from Cabo Ortegal and Bragança compositionally overlap those of the Jijal Complex (Moreno et al. 2001).

> NOTE: Perhaps move one of the chromitite plots adding the comparison with Bragança and Kohistan.

In this model, the nature and location of the crust-mantle transition remains unclear. Two main alternatives can be envisaged: 
- According to Moreno et al. (2001), it is located at the base of the layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association, which is assumed to be in tectonic contact along Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF) against the eastern, harzburgitic part of the *Herbeira* massif.
- According to Brown et al. (2009) and Llana-Fúnez et al. Brown et al. (2012), it is represented by the E contacts of the ultramafic massifs and the granulites. 

Interestingly, the latter alternative is compatible with the formation of the layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association within the mantle (Girardeau et al. 1989, Gravestock 1992, Tilhac et al. 2016), for instance at the expense of permeability and/or viscosity barrier such as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). The questionable tectonic relevance of the THF (further discussed in **Stop 7**) and the origin of type-1 pyroxenites by peridotite replacement provide a additional support to this interpretation.

The magmatic history described above is consistent with the activity of Cambro-Ordovician (at _ca._ 500 Ma) to Neoproterozoic arc (**Fig_geodynamics**), potentially corresponding to the incipient stage of a Cadomian arc built on a rifted margin of Gondwana (Tilhac et al. 2017), as previously invoked in NW (Andonaegui et al., 2016) and SW Iberia (_e.g._, Rojo-Pérez et al. 2024, Novo-Fernandez et al. 2024). Arc magmatism on the Gondwanan margin facing the Tornquist (or possibly the Iapetus) Ocean is further supported by detrital zircons derived from the West African which yielded prominent age peaks at around ~2.1 and ~2.7 Ga (Santos Zalduegui et al. 1995, Albert et al. 2015, Roper 2016). In the Iberian Autochthon, thick sedimentary sequences due to high rates of subsidence and the voluminous volcanics of the *Ollo de Sapo* formation record early-Ordovician extension as a consequence of continental rifting and the separation of the arc from the Gondwanan margin (Martinez Catalan et al. 2019, and references therein).

In the Cabo Ortegal Complex, such reworking of a Gondwanan margin during arc magmatism is compatible with the radiogenic isotope data available for the pyroxenites. This data include decoupled Hf-Nd with ε<sub>Hf(i)</sub> exceeding + 100 corresponding to Paleoproterozoic to Archean Hf model ages (Tilhac et al. 2020) as well as moderately enriched (_i.e._ EM1) Pb, Sr and Nd isotopes (Gravestock 1992, Santos et al., 2002, Tilhac et al. 2017).

> NOTE: A summary of this isotopic data could be useful here. 

### 5.2 Prograde tectonothermal evolution: the Devonian subduction

All the HP units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex record a deformation episode D<sub>1</sub> (Ábalos et al. 2003) ascribed to a Devonian subduction (**Fig_P-T-t-paths**). In the ultramafic massifs, it is recorded by a mylonitic foliation near tectonic contacts and sheath folds developed during thrusting of the massifs over the underlying granulites.

<img src="fieldguide_figures/p-t-paths.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 500px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_P-T-t-paths**. P-T-t paths of the different HP units showing geochronological and geothermobarometric constraints on protolith formation and deformation episodes D<sub>1</sub> to D<sub>4</sub>, with respect subduction, tectonic accretion, forced return flow (syn-subduction exhumation) in a subduction channel, and the subsequent exhumation during orogenic collision (Abalos et al. 2003).

Until recently, these folds depicting the style of deformation in deep subduction settings (Ábalos et al. 2003) had been recognized in all the units of the Upper Allochthon (Azcárraga et al. 2002), except in the *Limo* and *Herbeira* massifs. *Limo* was initially described as structurally homogeneous (Ben Jamaa, 1988, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, García Izquierdo et al. 2011) due to the strong alteration of most outcrops inland. However, good exposures of harzburgites were found in the NW cliffs revealing large-scale stacking of extremely elongated sheath folds (Puelles et al. 2012). Similar folds were then found affecting both peridotites and pyroxenites in the *Herbeira* massif (Tilhac et al. 2016, Tilhac 2017), indicating that the massif underwent D<sub>1</sub> as an entity, and that formation of the main pyroxenites pre-date this deformation episode. 

<img src="fieldguide_figures/sheath-folds.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 500px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_sheath-folds**. Sheath folds affecting harzburgites near seal level at *Punta Robaliceira* (**a**) as well pyroxenites and dunites in the lower part of Herbeira cliffs **(b)**, as shown in the map of the *Herbeira* massif (**Fig_map-Herbeira**). 

D<sub>1</sub> was coeval or rapidly followed by the peak of eclogite-facies metamorphism well documented in all the HP units  (1.6-1.8 GPa for the pyroxenites and up to 2.2 GPa for the eclogites). In the ultramafic massifs, it corresponds to the appearance of Grt in massive websterites as well limited partial melting evidenced by rare cross-cutting pyroxenite veins (Peucat et al., 1990) and intrusive granite bodies (Santos et al., 1996).

In addition, the ultramafic massifs have experienced high-temperature shear deformation D<sub>HT</sub> (Ábalos et al. 2003) at > 1000 °C which pre-dates D<sub>1</sub> (**Fig_P-T-t-paths**). It is recorded by A-type (Jung & Karato, 2001) lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) in Ol, as evidenced by early petrofabric studies (Ben Jamaa, 1988, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, Girardeau et al. 1990) and confirmed by EBSD techniques applied to the *Limo* (Puelles et al. 2012) and *Herbeira* massifs (García-Izquierdo 2005, García-Izquierdo et al. 2011, Henry et al. 2017, Henry 2018). This deformation episode is responsible for a tectonic foliation parallel to the compositional layering as well isoclinal folding and boudinage, particularly outlined by pyroxenites (**Fig_HT-deformation**).

style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 500px; height: auto;"/>
 
**Fig_HT-deformation**. Representative examples of HT deformation features (Tilhac, 2017): typical boudinage of a pyroxenite layer in the *Herbeira* cliffs (**a**) and isoclinal fold outlined by a pyroxenite layer (**b**).
 
Tilhac et al. (2016) suggested that the sequence of D<sub>HT</sub> (_i.e._ potentially asthenospheric deformation), followed by D<sub>1</sub> and the peak of prograde metamorphism corresponds to the delamination of the arc root and its incorporation into the Devonian subduction zone. Foundering is thought to have occurred as a consequence of the negative buoyancy of the arc root, owing to the large amount of ultramafic pyroxenites denser the ambient mantle (Müntener et al. 2001), The presence of ultramafic cumulates (_e.g._, pyrigarnites) in the *Bacariza* formation may have additionnally contributed to the gravitational instability of the arc root. These lithologies known as "arclogites" are indeed considered as some of the most likely candidates to undergo delamination in arc root settings (Ducea et al. 2021).

The *Herbeira* massif of Cabo Ortegal Complex could thus represent a unique example of delaminated arc root, potentially including the deep lithospheric portions of the sub-arc mantle.

### 5.3 Exhumation an emplacement

Fast exhumation seems to have rapidly followed the HP event (~1 GPa in < 10 Ma; Albert et al. 2012). The corresponding episode D<sub>2</sub> was mainly been reconstructed from the tectonothermal evolution of the eclogite-facies *Banded* gneiss (**Fig_exhumation-stages**) and cross-correlations with structures of the Órdenes Complex (Martínez Catalán et al. 2002). It corresponds to the underplating of the HP units to form a unique assemblage at _ca._ 375 Ma (Ábalos et al. 2003, Albert et al. 2012), after 10-20 My within a subduction conduit, in good agreement with exhumation rates predicted by numerical models of syn-convergent extrusion (_e.g._, Beaumont et al. 2009).

<img src="fieldguide_figures/exhumation-stages.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 500px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_exhumation-stages**. Different stages of exhumation of the HP units interpreted from the tectonothermal evolution of the eclogite-facies gneisses (Albert et al. 2012): **a.** development of a regional mylonitic foliation; **b.** syn-convergence extensional detachments and **c.** recumbent folds and thrusts; **d.** idealized cross section of the Cabo Ortegal Complex.

There is little record of D<sub>2</sub> (and subsequent episodes) in the ultramafic massifs, apart from the isoclinal folding of the *Uzal* peridotites and *Bacariza* granulites. However, several observations indicate that the peridotites were still relatively hot (Gayk & Kleinschrodt, 2000, Azcárraga et al. 2002, Ábalos et al. 2003). For instance, near the contact with the *Uzal* peridotites, the *Chimparra* gneisses provide extensive evidence of partial melting dated at 391 ± 8 Ma (Ordóñez Casado et al. 2001) and textures resembling those of high-grade contact metamorphism.

> NOTE: Add image of the Uzal fold here.

Development of recumbent folds and of a basal thrust (D<sub>3</sub>) accompanied retrograde metamorphism under amphibolite-facies conditions (including amphibolitization of the hydrated peridotites and pyroxenites). D<sub>3</sub> recumbent folds are additionally affected by upright folds without axial planar foliation (D<sub>4</sub>) such as the large open synform observed in the *Bacariza* granulites and in the *Herbeira* massif (**Fig_map-herbeira**). This last episode, potentially coeval with development of the THF, occurred under greenschist-facies conditions (Ábalos et al. 2003).

Final emplacement of Upper Allochthon on the Iberian parautochthon occurred at _ca._ 360 Ma (Dallmeyer et al. 1997).

## 6. Excursion stops

### Day 1: Herbeira massif (September 30<sup>th</sup>, full day)

The day focusses on the *Herbeira* massif, which is the largest and most lithologically heterogeneous ultramafic massif of the Cabo Ortegal Complex (**Fig_map-Herbeira**). It will be split into two main parts.

- In the morning, we will first walk approx. 1 km from the *Vixía Herbeira* lookout along the edge of the *Herbeira* cliffs to get an overview of the lithological diversity of actual cliffs in much more accessible outcrops.
- After lunch at a nearby lookout in the *Uzal* peridotite massif (15-min drive), we will do a 2-km return walk along a dirt road to observe some of the intriguing features that occur near the tectonic contact onto granulites to the SW and reach the harzburgites that dominate the inland part of the massif, as well as of the other two massifs of the complex (Limo and Uzal).

**Fig_map-Herbeira**. Interpretative geological map of the *Herbeira* massif (Tilhac et al. 2016, and references therein) showing (**a**) sheath-fold deformation cross-cutting lithological contacts and (**b**) the THF-related area surrounding the gradual contact between dunites and harzburgites, along the axial surface of the synform (see **Stop 7**). Fault lines correspond either to strike-slip faults (continuous lines) or contacts (thrust patterns) with granulites. Cross sections sampled by Girardeau et al. (1989) and Tilhac et al. (2016) are numbered 1-3 with the corresponding synthesic log shown for section 2. Note that the synformal structure of the massif is partly conditionned by the dunite body mapped along the SE boundary of the massif (Puelles et al., 2012). Outcrops that support the existence of this dunite are mostly limited to the now inaccessible area of *Mina David*, an open pit mine exploited by *Pasek Minerales*. The extracted material, so-called "dunite HT" (a refractory material used in thermal power plant) is indeed reported with an homogeneous content of 37% MgO (Caballero, 2009) consistent with the dunite compositions measured in the cliffs area (Tilhac et al. 2016).

#### Stop 1: "Vixía Herbeira" lookout

The first stop of the day is the lookout of the *Vixía Herbeira* (613 m), the highest point of the *Serra de la Capelada* and one of the highest sea cliffs in Europe (**Fig_herbeira-lookout**). Its iconic landmark, the *Garita de Herbeira* (literally "Herbeira’s watchtower"), a stone construction from the 18<sup>th</sup> century, was part of a series of coastal watch posts. The current building, entirely made of ultramafic rocks, dates from 1805 and was renovated in 2003.

Note the meaningfull name "Herbeira" for this very grassy area, derived from the Galician word *herba* (grass). Photo credit: R. Tilhac.

**Structure of the Herbeira massif**. From this point, we will introduce the main lithological variations of the massif (**Fig_map-Herbeira**):

- To the N, down the *Punta Robaliceira*, serpentinized harzburgites occur along the shore line along with minor pyroxenites and wehrlites. Thanks to marine erosion, these rocks exhibit spectacular sheath folds (García-Izquierdo 2005, Tilhac 2017) similar to those described in the *Limo* massif (Puelles et al. 2012) and marked by a weakly defined foliation and well-developed linear fabric.
- To the NW, below us, abundant pyroxenites make up to 80-90 % of a ~3 km-long, 300 m-thick lenticular domain exposed in the *Herbeira* cliffs. Individual layers may reach up to 3 m in thickness with a lateral extent exceeding 100 m. They alternate mostly with dunites, particularly in the top and middle part of the pyroxenite-rich domain, and with harzburgites in its lower parts. This body preserve the best and most abundant pyroxenite outcrops of the complex, and among the largest amounts of pyroxenite in orogenic massifs worldwide. It has notably been investigated in detail through sampling of several cross sections sampled by Girardeau et al. (1989, 1990, 1991) and Tilhac et al. (2016, 2017, 2020). Unfortunately, walking down the steeply dipping cliffs (about 65º) is not suitable for a large party. Detailed study of these cross sections suggest that the actual shape of the pyroxenite-rich domain may be more complex. Most pyroxenites are found between altitudes ~150 and ~350 m below us, whereas they are found at a higher altitude in the *Punta Robaliceira*'s section (~400-500 m), and to a lesser extent at ~300m. It may thus consist of a pile of at least two connected lenticular bodies and/or blocks of variable extent. Their detailed characterization is complicated by NW-trending Alpine faults, glacial geomormology (Alberti 2023) and recent landlisdes, some of which are currently active and monitored (Horacio et al. 2019a & b).

The *Vixía Herbeira* is located in the very top-left corner of the picture. Photo credit: R. Tilhac.

- To the W, in the lower part of the cliffs, sheath folds have been described in the lower part of the pyroxenite-rich domain (Tilhac et al. 2016, Tilhac 2017) indicating that the *Herbeira* massif probably underwent the related deformation episode (D<sub>1</sub>) as an entity, likely constrained by the presence of abundant pyroxenites, rheologically competent with respect to surrounding peridotites. This observation provide an important field confirmation that the main pyroxenites pre-date the Devonian subduction episode.
- To the NE, near the top of the ridge of *Punta Robaliceira*, a Grt-rich, 3 to 5 m-thick mafic layer was described by Girardeau and Gil Ibarguchi (1991), most likely unrelated to the main pyroxenites.
- To the S of the *Vixía Herbeira*, in a broad area along the cliff edge, a dunite-dominated domain outcrops associated with relatively abundant chromitites and locally wehrlitic bands.
- To the SE, a dominantly harzburgitic plateau represents the mantle tectonic that outcrops over most of the wind farm inland. Thin pyroxenite layers and minor dunite represent < 10 % in volume in this area which resembles exposures of the *Limo* and *Uzal* massif.

#### Stop 2: Type-1 pyroxenite

This outcrop (**Fig_type1-outcrop**) is an example of Ol-bearing clinopyroxenites and websterites that preserve dunite lenses (type-1 pyroxenites of Tilhac et al. 2016).

<img src="fieldguide_figures/type1-outcrop.png"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 500px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_type1-outcrop**. **a.** Outcrop of type-1 pyroxenite in the upper dunite, near the edge of the *Herbeira* cliffs. **b.** Detail view. Photo credit: M.A. Lopez-Sanchez.

Type-1 pyroxenites represent among the earliest pyroxenite generations in Cabo Ortegal (see **Section 3.2**). They are, along with type 4, the most primitive type of pyroxenites, with 20-24 % MgO, 2-3 % Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and high Mg# of 87–89 (Cpx Mg# > 0.91; **Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**). Type-1 pyroxenites plot along the Fo-An join within the nepheline-normative, silica-deficient field in the Fo-CaTs-Qz projection. Such a trend towards the Fo apex is ascribed to melt-peridotite interaction in orogenic pyroxenites (Bodinier et al. 2008, Lambart et al. 2012).

In Cabo Ortegal, these pyroxenites are specifically interpreted as products of partial replacement of peridotites upon interaction with a Si-undersaturated melt called ultra-calcic picrite, as suggested by their high Cpx/Opx ratios which point to crystallization along a Cpx–Ol cotectic line. The incomplete remplacement reaction is indicated by the preservation of dunite lenses, suggesting that melt was the limiting reactant. Relatively low melt/rock ratios are supported by the lowest Amp  among the pyroxenites (6-14 %) as well as LILE and LREE enrichment limited to spoon-shaped patterns with flat heavy REE (HREE) (**Fig_REE-type1**). Yet, the occurrence of Ol-free type-1 pyroxenites suggests that the replacement process locally achieved complete consumption of Ol following a peritectic reaction Fo + Si-rich melt = En, indicating pressures < 1.2 GPa (_e.g._, Kelemen & Ghiorso, 1986).

#### Stop 3.1. Semi-massive chromitites

After passing by an isoclinal fold (**Fig_isoclinal-pyroxenite**), we reach the area of **Stop 3**, where we will observe the first chromitite of the day and most of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenite subtypes.

The main outcrop of **Stop 3.1** is a sequence of several irregular layers or schlieren hosted in dunite. They extend laterally over several m with an individual thickness ranging from single grains to 3-4 cm (**Fig_chromitite-outcrop**). This occurrence corresponds to the semi-massive (< 80 % Chr), high-Cr# (0.75–0.82) chromitite (type II) of García-Tudela et al. (2024), which was classified in a broad group of Chr-rich dunite (< 75 % Chr) by Moreno et al. (2001).

García-Tudela et al. (2024) suggested that the parental melt of the semi-massive (type-II) chromitites is a fore-arc basalt using empirical calculations based on the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> contents of Chr. This interpretation is further discussed along with the origin of the rest of Cabo Ortegal chromitites in **Stop 4** and **6**.

#### Stop 3.2. Type-2 pyroxenite

Walking W from **Stop 3.1**, we encounter (among other pyroxenite layers) an example (not pictured here) of massive websterite (type-2 pyroxenites of Tilhac 2017). Most occurrences of this type are found in the central part of the pyroxenite-rich domain where massive outcrops reaching several m in thickness can be observed (_e.g._, **Fig_massive-pyroxenite**).

<img src="fieldguide_figures/massive-pyroxenite.jpg"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 500px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_massive-pyroxenite**. Among the best example of massive (~ 3-m-thick) Spl-/Grt-facies pyroxenite (sample CO-006; Tilhac et al. 2016) from the *Herbeira* cliffs (not included in this excursion; Tilhac, 2017).

Type-2 pyroxenites are likely to represent a latter generation of pyroxenites than type 1. They are more evolved with 20-21 % MgO, 3-6 % Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Mg# of 83-88 (Cpx Mg# of 0.88-0.92; **Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**). Type-2 pyroxenites plot along the En-CaTs join on the Fo-CaTs-Qz diagram, similarly to experimental cumulates of hydrous basaltic andesites (Müntener et al. 2001). Their Ol-free, lower Cpx/Opx modal compositions suggest that they crystallized from a Si-saturated (boninitic) melt, most likely distinct from the picritic melt parental to type-1 pyroxenites, as discussed in **Section 3.2**. However, some websterites (type 2) may represent more advanced product of the melt-peridotite interaction that produced type-1 pyroxenites at the expense of locally higher melt/rock ratios.

Higher and more variable melt/rock ratios in type-2 pyroxenites are indicated by variable LREE enrichment over nearly flat HREE (**Fig_REE-type2**), ascribed to chromatographic re-equilibration with incompatible-element enriched residual melts (Tilhac et al. 2016). This enrichment was potentially enhanced by the (porosity-reducing) crystallization of hydrous residual melts, as suggested by higher proportions of Amp in type-2 pyroxenites (5-26 %). The process envisaged by Tilhac et al. (2016) is similar to the percolative fractional crystallization model of Harte et al. (1993).

**Fig_REE-type2**. Chondrite-normalized REE compositions of Cpx and Amp from Cabo Ortegal type-2 pyroxenites (Tilhac et al. 2016).

Outward percolation of excess residual melts metasomatized the host peridotites as well as pre-existing, type-1 pyroxenites. Tilhac et al. (2016) described a composite sample of type-1 pyroxenite that exhibit increasing Amp contents and a progressive LREE and LILE enrichment (**Fig_CO-010**). Formerly classified as a transitional sample between type-1 and type-3 pyroxenite, it probably represents the deformed product of a type-1 pyroxenite protolith mesomatized by the late-magmatic websteritic melts.

Accordingly, Gravestock (1992) reported a positive correlation between the amount of pyroxenites and the extent of LREE enrichment in the harzburgites. 

#### Stop 3.3. Type-3 pyroxenite

Continuing towards the cliff edge, we reach an example (not pictured here) of strongly foliated pyroxenites (type 3 of Tilhac 2017).

These pyroxenites are characterized by the highest modal proportion of Amp (8-43 %) among Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites. Their major-element compositions overlap with those of type-1 and -2 pyroxenites (**Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**). Most type-3 pyroxenites mimic the high MgO of type 1 wheras others reach similarly high Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as type-2 pyroxenites (**Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**). However, they differ in having a higher Na<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>O (up to 0.8-0.9 %) and systematically LREE-enriched patterns with negative MREE-to-HREE slopes (**Fig_REE-type3**).

**Fig_REE-type3**. Chondrite-normalized REE compositions of Cpx and Amp from Cabo Ortegal type-3 pyroxenites (Tilhac et al. 2016).

Most type-3 pyroxenites are interpreted as the deformed and hydrated (amphibolitized) products of the other two types, preferentially type-1 pyroxenites. Dunite lenses and layers may have indeed provided preferential pathways for fluids percolation and deformation localization in type-1 pyroxenite protoliths (**Fig_amphibolitization**).

**Fig_amphibolitization**. Sketch depicting the model proposed by Tilhac (2017) & Henry et al. (2017) for the formation of type-3 pyroxenites, preferentially from on a protolith similar to those of type-1 pyroxenites; increasing deformation by axial compression and shear eventually stacks pyroxenites layers (**1 & 2**) creating preferential pathways for fluid percolation and amphibolitization (**3**).

Accordingly, where sheath folds affect pyroxenites (in the lower part of the pyroxenite-rich domain), the latter are systematically of type 3, and particularly strongly amphibolitized. This observation suggests that most of the hydration was syn-kinematic of the high-shear strain deformation episode (D<sub>1</sub>) and that metamorphic amphibolitization (which produced undeformed idiomorphic Amp) is mostly post-kinematic and contemporaneous to the regional amphibolite-facies metamorphism during exhumation stage D<sub>3</sub>.

#### Stop 4.1: Massive chromitites

We reach the area around **Stop 4** where most of the chromitite outcrops of the *Herbeira* massif are encountered. This area was mapped in detail by Monterrubio Pérez (1991) (**Fig_map-Monterrubio-Perez**), who first discovered platiniferous chromitite here as part of his work on mineralization in ultramafic rocks of the Variscan belt of Spain. Chromium and Pt concentrations were measured along trenches dug by the *Empresa Nacional Adaro de Investigaciones Mineras* (ENADIMSA), one the ancestors of the Spanish geological survey. Subsequent investigation of these chromitites by Moreno (1999) revealed concentrations > 13 000 ppb ΣPGE, with Pt and Pd being much more concentrated (10 900 ppb) than Os, Ir and Ru (< 1365 ppb).

It would actually be nice to digitalize it as we could show on this same map all the itinerary of the day. I will try if I find the time.

The main outcrop of **Stop 4.1** is a massive chromitite hosted in dunite. It is one of the most spectacular of the *Herbeira* massif as it features oblique cross sections through a sequence of irregular chromitite layers sandwiched between layered pyroxenites and dunites  (**Fig_chromitites**).

This occurrence corresponds to the massive (> 80 % Chr), intermediate-Cr# (0.60–0.66) chromitite (type I) of García-Tudela et al. (2024), classified as chromitites _sensu stricto_ (_i.e._ > 75 % Chr) by Moreno et al. (2001). This outcrop also yielded some of the highest PGE concentrations measured in the Cabo Ortegal chromitites.

#### Stop 4.2: Type-4 pyroxenites

Located about 50 m away from **Stop 4.1**, this outcrop (**Fig_type4-outcrop**) is among the best examples of Opx-rich websterites and orthopyroxenites (type-4 pyroxenites of Tilhac 2017). It is noteworthy that this type is abundant in this area, often spatially associated with chromitites, while it is relatively rare in the rest of the *Herbeira* massif except, but to a lesser extent, in the lower dunite exposed in *Punta Robaliceira*.

Type-4 pyroxenites exhibit the highest Mg# (and Cr#) and lowest Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> of all types of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites. They are interpreted as the most primitive products of the low-Ca boninite parental to type-2 pyroxenites (and possibly also of the chromitites, as suggested by their spatial association with type-4 pyroxenites). Indeed, the combination of their Opx-rich and primitive characters cannot be reconciled with the ultra-calcic picrite inferred from type-1 pyroxenites. This interpretation is consistent with the highly variable REE compositions of their Cpx, comparable to the extremely depleted and enriched endmembers of type-2 pyroxenites. This is an expected chromatographic consequence of the lower modal proportions of Cpx in type-4 pyroxenites (_e.g._, Godard et al. 1995).

> NOTE: Add type-4 REE compositions (appendix A1 Tilhac et al. 2016)

The field occurrence of type-4 pyroxenites is dominated by very coarse-grained pods or boudins that appear to be wrapped by the foliation of the host harzburgites (**Fig_type4-pods**). This observation may reflect a combination of a greater competence owing to their higher Opx content and the fact that they represent a later generation of pyroxenites (along with type 2), less affected by HT deformation.

#### Stop 5: "Chao do Monte" lookout

We will have lunch at the *Chao do Monte* (literally "flatland of the hill") lookout (360 m),  a pasture for cows and horses near the NE edge of the ultramafic massif of *Uzal*. It provides great views to the NE  towards the granulites and *Herbeira* cliffs  (**Fig_Uzal-panorama**). To the W, we can also observe the rest of the folded Uzal massif down to the *Playa de Cortés* beach and the *Chimparra*  gneiss outcropping forming the ridge of *Punta Tarroiba* (**Fig_playa-de-cortes**).

#### Stop 6: Chromitites associated with pyroxenites

This highly heterogeneous outcrops exhibit a folded sequence of dunite interlayered with pyroxenites and various chromitites, occurring both as irregular layers with sharp boundaries and variable thickness (locally forming pods) as well as trails of variously concentrated disseminated grains (**Fig_chromitites-group-b**).

**Fig_chromitites-group-b**. **a.** Overview of the outcrop. **b-c.** Details of the association of chromitite with pyroxenite layers. **d.** Details of variously concentrated Spl grains disseminated in dunite (Tilhac, 2017).

While most chromitites hosted in the upper dunite have a relatively high Cr#, comparable to chromite in boninites (Barnes & Roedder, 2001), chromitite samples from this outcrop (group-B chromitites of Tilhac 2017) have a markedly lower Cr#, overlapping with Spl compositions in the pyroxenites (**Fig_spl-summary**).

 Overall, Spl compositions in Cabo Ortegal show a strong control of both Cr-Al and Fe-Ti trends (Tilhac 2017), resulting in a well-defined Spl gap around the solid solution solvus (Sack & Ghiorso, 1991).
- The Cr-Al trend, commonly observed in mantle terranes and xenoliths is mostly seen in type-1 pyroxenites. It is mainly interpreted as the result of subsolidus re-equilibration between Spl and silicates (Barnes & Roeder, 2001). 
- The Fe-Ti trend, commonly observed in mafic intrusions and arc-related ultramafic complexes, is seen in type-2 and type-3 pyroxenites. It is interpreted as the result of re-equilibration with residual melts and/or increasing oxidation state (Pagé & Barnes, 2009).

> NOTE: I am not sure this should be here and as it is in one block. Perhaps I should split it between section 3 and here. 

Compared to peridotites and pyroxenites, the relatively narrow range of Mg# (0.35-0.50) and high Cr contents observed in chromtites indicates more limited re-equilibration processes (except for the lower Cr# of group-B chromitites). Slight differences between massive (type-I) and semi-massive (type-II) chromitites, which were ascribed by Garcia-Tudela et al. (2024) to distinct parental melts, may also reflect variable extent of subsolidus re-equilibration. Massive chromitites are indeed the least likely to suffer from subsolidus re-equilibration with silicates and accordingly overlap with the compositional field of chromite in boninites (Barnes & Roedder, 2001), probably reflecting their actual parental melts.

> Add a conclusion here to support the overall cogeneticity of the chromitites with the boninitic series (along with a TE spyder).

#### Stop 7: The Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF)

After walking further 500 m along the dirt road, we reach the area inferred as the location intersected by the Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF), named by Moreno (1999) following original observations by Monterrubio Pérez (1991). 

Moreno et al. (2001) described the THF as a NNE-SSW brittle fault with a dextral shear sense, based on observations of brecciated ultramafic cataclasites with N-plunging lineations, particularly in farm excavations 125 m NE from the *Vixía Herbeira* (**Fig_thf-map**).

> NOTE: Add THF map from Moreno/Garcia-Izquierdo. 

In contrast, García-Izquierdo (2005) described this structure as a ~200-m-wide Trans Herbeira Shear Zone (THSZ) where deformation is concentrated in cm- to m-thick mylonitic bands (**Fig_thf-cross-section**). In the cross section near **Stop 7**, a grain-size decrease is observed in the Amp-rich peridotites as the structure is approach, accompanied by an increasingly dipping planar fabric which progressively aligns to the near-vertical mylonitic bands, cutting the compositional layering at a very low angle (**Fig_thf-foliation-map**). Subhorizontal lineations in the area are defined by the stretching of Px  and the orientation of Amp aggregates, similarly oriented to lineations observed across the massif. The anastomosing structure of the mylonitic bands indicate a sinistral movement in a transtensional regime, as suggested by SSW-plunging lineations (García-Izquierdo, 2005). The THF/THSZ is inferred to have normal component with the eastern block as hanging wall and an estimated vertical displacement of 400 m. 

> NOTE: Add THF cross section and folation map from Garcia-Izquierdo. 

Of interest here, the existence and nature of the THF/THSZ conditions our understanding of the structure of the *Herbeira* massif. Two interpretations are possible:
  - If it is a major structure with significant displacement, the massif may consist of two tectonically distinct units, interpreted as a lower-crustal layered sequence to the E and a mantle tectonic to the W, respectively (Moreno et al. 2001, García Izquierdo et al. 2011).
  - It it is only a minor structure with limited displacement, the lithological heterogeneity of the massif must be considered as a whole (Girardeau et al., 1989, Abalos et al., 2000, Puelles 2003), potentially forming an open synformal structure whose axial surface would be slightly oblique to the THF, (Ábalos et al. 2000, Puelles 2003), as suggested by foliation trajectories (see **Fig_map-Herbeira**)

More recently, Tilhac (2017) reported field observations where relatively fresh outcrops are preserved, indicating that the contact between harzburgites and dunites can be observed as a gradual increase in the proportion of Opx porphyroclasts over a few hundred metres (**Fig_thf-transition**). These observations support the latter interpretation in the sense that the THF does not put the harzburgites and dunites in tectonic contact, regardless of its brittle/ductile nature.

> NOTE: Move the harzburgite-dunite transition figure here.

Nonetheless, the area is affected by significant fluid circulation (**Fig_THF-features**), evidenced by high degrees of serpentinization and/or amphibolitization, and abundant quartz and asbestiform chrysotile (Ctl) veining.  Sub-vertical Grt-Chl-bearing veins were reported by Tilhac (2017) to the SW (**Stop 7.1**). Intrusions rich in Phl and Ap have been described associated with the mylonites by García-Izquierdo (2005). Demantoid (Cr-rich andrandite Grt) associated with Chl-Srp veins was interpreted as coeval to the end of the greenschist-facies retrograde metamorphism (<450ºC, Madon et al. 1991). 

> NOTE: I need to add here information about the new outcrops we spotted together (mylonites, Grt pyroxenites) and something about the Chl harzburgites which I will need help with) - **Stop 7.2**

Based on these observations, the THF is interpreted as a late structure where fluid-assisted faulting might have occurred locally (as indicated by breccias) and limited to minor displacement. It probably post-dates the thrusting of the massif onto the granulite (Tilhac, 2017), as suggested by talc-Chl-Srp-rich rocks (soapstone) exposed near the contact with granulites (Moreno, 1999). We further speculate that it may relate to local extensional regime around the axial surface of the synformal axial plane, potentially re-activating pre-existing mantle shear zones near the harzburgite-dunite transition. Shear zones might have also formed locally facilitated by rheological weakening induced by the presence of fluids/melts.

#### Stop 8: Layered pyroxenites (optional)

To wrap up the day, time and weather allowing, we will walk in small groups to see one of the rare outcrops of thick layered pyroxenites and dunites accessible without having to hike down the cliffs. The outcrop is located 100 m from the road in a steep but accessible ridge at the top of the *Punta Robaliceira* cross section (1; **Fig_map-Herbeira**).
