## 1. Introduction

The Cabo Ortegal Complex is known to the mantle community for its ultramafic massifs that preserve some of the best outcrops of pyroxenite among orogenic massifs worldwide (**Fig_layered-pyroxenites-1**). The main objective of this two-day excursion is to showcase some of these outcrops and get an overview of the geology of the complex. 

- On the first day, we will focus on the mantle rocks exposed in the largest and most lithologically heterogeneous massif of *Herbeira*.
- On the second, we will cover key petrological and structural features of other high-pressure units of the complex (granulites and eclogites).

## 2. Geological setting

> In think the paragraph below might need some more references. As for the rest of the section, I agree with Marco that we should keep it as visual as possible, but I also think that making sure the different units are mentionned is important - I remember struggling a lot when getting familiar with the local litterature...

The Cabo Ortegal Complex (Vogel, 1967) is one of the five allochthonous complexes (Cabo Ortegal, Malpica-Tuy and Órdenes in NW Spain, Bragança and Morais in Portugal) in the Iberian section of the Variscan orogenic belt (**Figure_geological-setting**). These complexes consist of various nappes of dismembered meta-sedimentary and meta-igneous terranes accreted to the Gondwanan margin during the Variscan collision. Their subdivisions are correlated into three main units (Arenas et al. 1986).

1. the Upper Allochton, representing fragments of a Cambro-Ordovician ensialic island arc;
2. the Ophiolitic Unit, representing remnants of debated oceanic domains with various Palaeozoic ages;
3. the Basalt unit, representing part of the distal Gondwanan margin.

The Cabo Ortegal Complex is mainly constituted of the two uppermost units (**Fig_map-Cabo-Ortegal**). 

The **Upper Allochton** is a 10-12 km-thick pile divided into an intermediate pressure (IP) unit of mainly amphibolite-facies meta-turbiditic gneisses (*Cariño* gneiss) and an ensemble of high-pressure (HP) units subdivided into:

- *Concepenido-La Capelada* unit, which includes all the lithologies of interest for this excursion: the main ultramafic massifs (*Limo*, *Herbeira* and *Uzal*), granulites (*Bacariza formation*), eclogites (*Concepenido* formation) and gneisses (*Banded gneiss* formation). They are described in detail in section 3 and 4.

- *Cedeira* unit, which includes paragneisses with granulitic mafic inclusions (*Chímparra* gneiss) and a heterogeneous nappe of high-temperature (HT) amphibolites, granulites and meta-gabbros (*Candelaria* formation). Ultramafic rocks occur along the shear zone (*Carreiro* shear zone; Azcárraga et al. 2002) that represents the contact to the underlying Ophiolitic unit. Mylonitic garnet (Grt)-facies harzburgites and olivine (Ol) orthopyroxenites have been interpreted as buried serpentinite indicating HP conditions up to 3 GPa (Gil Ibarguchi et al. 1999).

The **Ophiolitic Unit** includes two formations with unclear structural relationships: *Moeche* (Arenas et al. 2014b), formerly described as a sheet of mylonitic greenschists (Arenas et al. 1986, Arenas, 2015), and *Purrido* (Sánchez Martínez et al. 2011), which consists of monotonous amphibolites and Grt-bearing amphibolites of meta-gabbroic origin. A small unit of HT amphibolites (*Peña Escrita*) also occurs in the Upper Allochton in the structural continuity of *Purrido* formation, and both exhibit an E-MORB signature. The regional significance of these formations is far more limited than that of the better-preserved ophiolites of the Órdenes Complex (Arenas, 2015), recognized as one of the best suture of the Rheic Ocean in the European Variscides (Murphy et al. 2011), as well as remnants of other peri-Gondwana oceanic domains.

In the Cabo Ortegal Complex, the **Basal Unit** is only poorly exposed as the *Espasante* formation, consisting of felsic orthogneisses, amphibolites and minor retro-eclogites. It is associated with a 30-km-long tectonic mélange (*Somozas* formation), a typical serpentinite mélange characterized by tectonic blocks of meta-igneous (including a calc-alkaline suite dated at 527–499 Ma) and meta-sedimentary rocks wrapped around by a highly sheared serpentinite matrix. Together, they represent former pieces of the subducted Gondwanan margin and arc-derived section of peri-Gondwanan transitional crust, deformed and exhumed in a subduction channel (Arenas et al. 2009, Novo-Fernandez et al. 2016), now overlying the parautochthon.

## 3. The ultramafic massifs

> I have taken out this section of the HP units as it needs to be the main focus of this guide. Like this, as a standalone section, we can go into more detail without having to use too many levels of subsections. I have kept the same logic that you used with Field aspect, Protolith interpretations, Thermobarometric estimates and Age constraints as I find a great idea.

### 3.1 Field aspect & petrography

Ultramafic rocks are mainly exposed in the *Herbeira* (12.5 km<sup>2</sup>), *Limo* (6.6 km<sup>2</sup>) and *Uzal* (3.6 km<sup>2</sup>) massifs (**Fig_HP-units-simplified**), but also in ~40 sparse harzburgitic outcrops within *Bacariza* granulites, interpreted by some authors as tectonic windows. The massifs are always in contact with granulites except on the W edge of the *Uzal* massif, where they are in tectonic contact with the *Chímparra* gneiss.

**Fig_HP-units-simplified**. Simplified map of the HP units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex showing the location of the ultramafic massifs (Tilhac et al. 2016, and references therein).

The ultramafic rocks are primarily composed of harzburgites which dominate in the *Limo* and *Uzal* massifs. In contrast, the *Herbeira* massif preserves a mucher great lithological diversity, including harzburgites, pyroxenites, dunites and chromitites.

#### Harzburgites

As in *Limo* and *Uzal*, harzburgites constitute a mantle tectonite (along with thin and highly deformed pyroxenite layers) in the E part of the *Herbeira* massif (**Fig_harzburgites**). These rocks are predominantly amphibole (Amp)- and chlorite (Chl)-bearing Spl-facies harzburgites with < 2% clinopyroxene (Cpx), strongly serpentinized (up to 70% in extreme cases).

**Fig_harzburgites**. **a.** Relatively fresh harzburgite outcrop at the bottom of the cliffs near the NW boundary of the *Herbeira* massif; note the strong foliation outlined by aligned Opx porphyroclasts and trails of Chl and Spl. **b.** Serpentinized harzburgite representative of inland exposures in the *Herbeira* and *Limo* massifs; **c.** Detail of bastitized Opx porphyroclasts and Chl in the matrix. **d.** Strongly serpentinized harzburgite and thin pyroxenites in an inland outcrop (Tilhac, 2017).

Harzburgites exhibit a porphyroclastic texture with 5-10mm orthopyroxene (Opx) porphyroblasts embedded in an Ol matrix (**Fig_harzburgites**). They contain up to 30% of Mg-hornblende and < 10% of Spl occurring as < 5 mm grains. Spinel (Spl), Amp, and Chl, often associated with Mag, define the schistosity.

Less voluminous peridotitic lithologies such as lherzolites and wehrlites also occur sporadically. They are observed with diffuse contacts to pyroxenites in the pyroxenite-rich domain, in the mantle tectonite at the bottom of the *Herbeira cliffs* (**Fig_lherzolite-outcrop**) and associated with dunite and chromitites above the pyroxenite-rich domain. They were described as “impregnated” dunites and harzburgites by Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi (1991).

#### Pyroxenites

Pyroxenites particularly abundant (80–90%) in a 3-km long, 300 m thick domain (potentially consisting of one or several lenticular bodies) exposed in the W cliffs of the *Herbeira* massif (Girardeau et al. 1989, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991). They generally occur interlayered with dunites or as massives outcrops with individual layers reaching up to 3 m in thickness and a lateral extent exceeding 100 m. The Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites have been classified based on their field occurence as follows (**Fig_pyroxenites**; Tilhac et al. 2016, Tilhac 2017): 

- *Type 1*. Ol-clinopyroxenites and websterites with dunite lenses;
- *Type 2*. Massive websterites; 
- *Type 3*. Foliated, amphibolitized pyroxenites;
- *Type 4*. Subordinate Opx-rich websterites and orthopyroxenites.

**Fig_pyroxenites**. Representrative outcrops of the different types of pyroxenites in the *Herbeira* massif (Tilhac, 2017).

Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites have medium- to coarse-grained granoblastic to porphyroclastic textures. Representative modal compositions (**Fig_pyroxenites-mode**) are approx. 30–80 % Cpx, 0–45 % Opx, 5-40 % Amp, 2–8 % Spl, 6–7 % Grt when present, < 1 % base-metal sulfides and 1-2 % Chl when present. Pyroxenes (Cr-diopside and enstatite) occur either as 1-5 mm exsolved porphyroclasts with complex boundaries or as 50–800 μm exsolution-free neoblasts. Olivine occurs as relatively fresh dunitic lenses, as interstitial trails associated with Spl and Amp, and as inclusions in pyroxene (Px). Spinel is found either as rounded enclosed grains or as large (rarely idiomorphic) interstitial grains, associated with sulfides. It is also observed associated with Px and Amp as a mesh of exsolved needles often delineating curved-shaped cores (**Fig_subsolidus-assemblages**). The latter contrast with exsolution-free rims or halos around enclosed Spl grains. Garnet occurs only in some massive websterites (type 2), either in equilibrium with Px, as coronas around Spl (**Fig_subsolidus-assemblages**) or with symplectites of Spl and pyroxenes (± Amp, Ilm).

**Fig_pyroxenites-mode**. Modal compositions of the different types of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites. Thin layers (<5-cm thick) are indicated as their modal composition may be strongly affected by mechanical mixing with the host peridotites (Tilhac et al. 2016).

> Ideally I would also add a representative range for the Cabo Ortegal peridotites.

Amphibole occurs in all pyroxenites either as pre- to syn-kinematic xenomorphic grains in textural equilibrium with Cpx (Amp I) or more commonly as clearly post-kinematic (_i.e._ internally undeformed), replacing Cpx (± Spl) among matrix minerals, often as idiomorphic crystals (**Fig_subsolidus-assemblages**). It is locally associated with vermicular Spl and replacing Px exsolution lamellae. These two textural generations, confirmed by electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) data, are respectively interpreted as evidence of late-magmatic crystallization of residual melts (Amp I) and of hydration and retrograde metamorphism (Amp II). Extreme cases of amphibolitization produce hornblendites with poikilitic textures.

> This is just a quick example from my JPet paper, but I could add some more, showing for example representative granoblastic and porphyroclastic textures, some symplectite after Grt breakdown, etc.

Accessory Chl occurs often associated with Spl after or in textural equilibrium with Amp. Base-metal sulfides are relatively fresh (<20 % of alteration products such as Fe oxyhydrodrides) and occur as either rounded homogeneous inclusions in silicates or more commonly large interstitial grains exsolving pyrrhotite (Po), pentlandite (Pn) and chalcopyrite (Ccp), particularly when associated with Amp. Rare platinum-group minerals (PGM) have been found, mainly Pt– Pd-rich tellurides, bismuthides and arsenides, hosted as needles in sulfides (Tilhac et al. 2016, Tilhac 2017).

#### Dunites & chromitites

In the *Herbeira* massif, dunites outcrop alternately with pyroxenites and chromitites or as massive outcrops (**Fig_chromitites**). It is the most common lithology above (_i.e._ upper dunite of Moreno et al. 2001), and to a lesser extent, below the pyroxenite-rich area (_i.e._ lower dunite of Moreno et al. 2001). Transition to the pyroxenite-rich area is gradational, showing an a downward and upward decrease in the frequency of distinctively weathering pyroxenite layers. Some of these pyroxenite occurences (notably in the lower dunite) suggest that an a generation of thin pyroxenite layers pre-dates dunitization (**Fig_dissolved-pyroxenite**). Dunites pods occur less commonly as decameter-size pods with diffuse contacts within harzburgites (Santos et al. 2002), notably associated with chromitites at the beach level in the *Herbeira* cliffs (Moreno et al. 2001).

**Fig_dissolved-pyroxenite**. Chromite precipitated _via_ incongruent melting or dissolution of pyroxenes at the termination of a pre-existing pyroxenite layer in the lower dunite at *Punta Robaliceira* (Tilhac, 2017).

Despite being foliated, Cabo Ortegal dunites are less deformed and serpentinized than the harzburgites. Both the upper and lower dunites exhibit serpentinized mm-size Ol porphyroclasts and small neoblasts. Sporadic Opx and large (>3 mm) Cpx grains also occur interstitially, as well as Amp, Chl and locally Phl. A variety of accessory minerals has been reported (Monterrubio 1991, Monterrubio et al. 1992), including magnetite (Mag), Pn, Ccp, Po and heazlewoodite (Hzl). Chromian Spl occurs as elongated grains outlining the foliation. In the lower dunite, it is restricted to disseminated grains and rare, thin chromitite layers. In the upper dunite, it is much more abundant and occurs concentrated in pods, lenses or layers >10-cm thick (Monterrubio et al., 1992) and irregular concentrations (schlieren) up to 50-cm thick (Moreno 1999, Moreno et al. 2001). 

> There is this paper by Pereira et al. (2008) on Cabo Ortegal serpentinites that claims dunites is the most serpentinized lithology (>90 %), more than harzburgites... What do you think?

**Fig_chromitites**. **a & b**. Massive (type-I) chromitites in the upper dunite, near on the edge of the *Herbeira* cliffs, where most of the chromitites are observed. **c & d.** Chromitites associated with pyroxenite in different locations of the *Herbeira* massif (Tilhac, 2017).

> I have to find images of some semi-massive (type-II) examples (Garcia-Tudela et al. 2024).

Chromitite occurences in the upper dunite have been classified as follows (García-Tudela et al. 2024):

- *Type-I*. Massive (>80 % Chr) chromitites with coarse (>500 μm) Chr grains;
- *Type-II*. Semi-massive (<80 % Chr) chromitites with smaller and more altered Chr grains and pull-apart texture. 

In chromitites, Chr grains occur in a matrix of serpentine (Srp) and Chl. They may exhibit thin Fe-rich alteration rims and inclusions of Cpx, Amp, sulfides (mainly Pn and Ccp) and PGM (near grain boundaries in type II), as well as Chl and locally Ap in type-I and Ol in type-II chromitites. Detailed study of the PGM revealed a remarkably diversity of primary and secondary platinum-group sulphides, alloys, arsenides and other minerals (Moreno et al. 1999).

#### Other rocks

Mafic rocks occur as a 3–5 m thick outcrop near the top of the pyroxenite-rich domain, parallel to the main foliation (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991). It exhibits 5-20-cm granoblastic layers of Grt, Zo and minor Cpx, alternating with others rich in Amp ± Zo or Spl. K-feldspar (Kfs) and plagioclase (Plg) as well as kyanite (Ky) inclusions in Zo and Spl and corundum (Crn) inclusions in Grt have also been reported (Santos et al. 2002). A gradual transition is observed between these rocks and Grt clinopyroxenite with Rt partly replaced by titanite (Ttn) and minor Ilm. These lithologies originally described as a gabbroic facies by Girardeau et al. (1989) are most likely unrelated to the main (Al- and Ti-depleted) pyroxenites.

**Fig_pyroxenite-dykes**. **a & b**. Massive (type-I) chromitites in the upper dunite, near on the edge of the *Herbeira* cliffs, where most of the chromitites are observed. **c & d.** Chromitites associated with pyroxenite in different locations of the *Herbeira* massif (Tilhac, 2017).

Other lithologies include pyroxenite and Grt-rich dykes injected in C’-like tensional fractures, which commonly occur cross-cutting the compositional layering at a high angle (>30°; **Fig_pyroxenite-dykes**) in the pyroxenite-rich domain (Girardeau et al. 1990, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991). These dykes are only deformed in mylonitic bands near the contacts with underlying granulites, sealed in turn by undeformed pyroxenite dykes injected in Riedel fractures (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991), particularly abundant in the upper dunite.

### 3.2 Protolith interpretations

#### A brief historical review

The Cabo Ortegal Complex was originally studied by a group of Dutch researchers who published a series of very comprehensive articles describing the geology and petrology of the different units (Vogel, 1967, Maaskant, 1970, Engels, 1972, Den Tex et al. 1972), mostly in the journal edited by Leiden University *Leidse Geologische Mededelinge*, as well as the earliest geochemical and isotopic studies of the complex (Van Calsteren, 1978, 1979). The multiphase tectonothermal history of the HP units was quickly recognized as a significant impediment to understanding the origin of the ultramafic massifs:

*« Speculations about the origin of the ultrabasites are doomed to be fruitless in view of the various geological processes to which these rocks have been subjected. »* (Vogel, 1967)

The protoliths of Cabo Ortegal peridotites were at the time inferred to be a lherzolite where Cpx has been replaced by hornblende (Masskant, 1970). Their emplacement was ascribed to one or several diapirs segregated from a mantle plume either along an oceanic geotherm (Maaskantt 1970) or into the continental crust, thus responsible for granulites-facies metamorphism of originally eclogitic lower crust (Van Calsteren et al. 1977). In this context, the different pyroxenites were regarded as _in-situ_ partial melting products of the lherzolite.

More work was then carried out by a Spanish and French collaboration (Arenas et al., 1986; Bernard-Griffiths et al, 1985; Gil Ibarguchi et al., 1990, Peucat et al., 1990), notably focusing on the ultramafic massifs (_e.g._ Girardeau et al. 1989; Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi 1991), which were the subject of severeal PhD theses (Ben Jamaa, 1988, Monterrubio-Pérez 1991, Laribi-Halimi 1992, Gravestock, 1992, Moreno 1999). The peridotite protoliths were considered as a Spl-harzburgite (ascribing at least part of the amphibolitization to near-isochemical retrograde hydration) and interpreted as a residual oceanic mantle owing to its depleted mineral chemistry (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, Laribi-Halimi, 1992), potentially representing imbricated tectonic slices of a subducted slab (Gil Ibarguchi et al. 1990). However, relatively low ε<sub>Nd</sub> (~ +4) measured in a harzburgite compared to N-MORB-like eclogites with ε<sub>Nd</sub> (~ +10) and the occurrence of hundreds of meters of pyroxenite were problematic in such an oceanic setting (Ben Jamaa, 1988). A sub-continental influence and back-arc setting were thus envisaged (Peucat e al. 1990). In this context, the amount of melts required to form pyroxenites that represent 80-90% of a 300 m-thick, 3 km-long domain was considered unlikely to be produced _in situ_ as formerly proposed, and the intrusion of an external melt reacting with the ambient peridotite was recognized as a more reasonable scenario (Girardeau et al. 1989, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, Gravestock, 1992). 

#### Melt-peridotite interaction in an arc root

The layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association exposed in the *Herbeira* cliffs was specifically interpreted as the magmatic stratigraphy of a lower-crustal cumulate in an arc root, based on increasing platinum-group element (PGE) content (from the PGE-poor lower dunite to the PGE-rich upper dunite) and progressive PGE fractionation (_i.e._ Pd-Pt enrichment; **Fig_PGE**) in chromitites (Moreno, 1999, Moreno et al. 1999, Moreno et al., 2001). This arc-related interpretation provided a better explanation to the residual character of the harzburgites which was confirmed by Santos et al. (2002) based on mantle-array-like Ol chemistry (_i.e._ ~0.4 % NiO, Fo90). The latter authors also identified a fractional crystallization trend of decreasing NiO and Fo in Ol between the pyroxenites and dunites (see **fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**). They considered that the lithological heterogeneity of the *Herbeira* massif reflects a "mantle wedge" (in the broad sense) modified by slab-derived fluids or melts.

Location 2 corresponds to chromitite-bearing dunite pods in harzburgite (Moreno et al. 2001).

Following on the original work by Girardeau and coworkers, the ultramafic massifs were recently re-investigated as part of two PhD theses (Tilhac 2017, Henry 2018). A more comprehensive petrogenetic model combining magmatic differentiation and melt-peridotite interaction (**Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**) was formulated based on the classification of the the pyroxenite subtypes (Tilhac, 2017) and more recent solution and _in-situ_ geochemical data, including Sr-Nd-Hf-Os isotopes (Tilhac et al. 2016, 2017, 2020).

> I should probably add the trends as arrows in these diagams.

The proposed scenario (**Fig-petrogenetic_model**) invoked the intrusion into a lithospheric arc root of a primitive Si-depleted melt, variously interacting with the host harzburgites to produce dunites and chromitites, as well as Ol-bearing, Cpx-rich pyroxenites (type 1), which represent incomplete replacement products of their host (hence preserving dunite lenses). Massive Ol-free websterites (type 2) and subordinate Opx-rich websterites (type 4) either represent more differentiated products of this process and/or cumulates of a distinct Si-saturated melt (Tilhac et al. 2016).

Note the thin pyroxenite "dissolved" in dunite and leaving disseminated chromites behind (**Fig-dissolved-pyroxenite**), which suggests the existence of an older generation of pyroxenites.

#### Parental melts and source constraints

Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites have markedly higher SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaO, Cr and Sc contents and lower Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub> and Ni contents than pyroxenites from most ultramafic massifs (_e.g._ Horoman, Ronda, Beni Boussera, Lanzo, Lherz). High concentrations of compatible elements (_e.g._ Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> >0.4%) suggest that they crystallized from primitive melts. The pyroxenites are also characterised by low-Al pyroxenes indicating low Al/Si parental melts such as boninites or high-Mg# andesites. Very high CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> more specifically suggests high-Ca boninites or ultra-calcic picrites. The most primitive (type-1) pyroxenites indeed exhibit high Cpx/Opx ratios, pointing to crystallization along a Cpx–Ol cotectic line expected from ultra-calcic picrites (**Fig_normative-compositions**). In contrast, the more evolved (type-2) websterites rather exhibit a bonitic affinity and are comparable with experimental pyroxenitic cumulates of hydrous basaltic andesite and high-Mg# andesite at 1.2 GPa (Müntener et al. 2001).

**Fig_normative-compositions**. Normative compositions of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites in the pseudoternary system Fo–CaTs–Qz projected from Di (O’Hara, 1968). Light grey and dark grey arrows correspond to the potential differentiation trends for type-1 pyroxenites and type-2 pyroxenites, towards picrites and boninites, respectively. Ultra-calcic picrites are ankaramitic lavas from Vanuatu (Barsdell & Berry, 1990). High-Ca boninites are lavas from Tonga and the Troodos ophiolite (Crawford et al., 1989).

Such parental melts are compatible with the conclusion from Moreno et al. (2001) that the chromtitites crystallized from a S-poor, mantle-derived melt. Indeed, the abundance of sulfides (up 1 %) cannot be accounted for by the low S contents of boninitic or picritic melts, which must at least partly relate to a secondary S addition (Tilhac et al. 220), as suggested by the textural association between interstitial sulfides and Amp (_e.g._ Tilhac et al. 2016, and references therein). Accordingly, empirical calculations based on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> contents in chromitites yield parental melt compositions comparable to a fore-arc (_i.e._ low-Ti) basalt and a boninite for type-I and -II chromitites, respectively (García-Tudela et al. 2024). However, these inferences rely on the assumption that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> contents in Chr are primary chemical compositions, whereas the observed differences could relate to subsolidus re-equilibration (_e.g._ Pagé & Barnes 2009; Tilhac, 2017).

Constraints on melt sources are provided by high CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, low TiO<sub>2</sub> and alkalis, and selective large ion lithophile (LILE)/high field strength elements (HFSE) enrichment. The parental melt of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites is thought to have been produced from a low Cpx/Opx (_i.e._ harzburgitic) source, metasomatized by slab- or mantle-wedge derived hydrous fluids or silicate melts (Tilhac et al. 2016) or carbonatites (Gravestock, 1992).

> Perhaps a spyder diagram to show the LILE/HFSE enrichment here.

In this context, the subordinate mafic rocks (and related pyroxenites) are most likely unrelated to the main pyroxenites. The mafic rocks are indeed Al- and Ti-rich (contrasting with the Al, Ti and HFSE depletion of the main pyroxenites, characteristic of arc settings). They also exhibit positive Eu, Sr and Ba anomalies and high alkali contents suggesting the former presence of Plg (Santos et al. 2002). 

### 3.3 Thermobarometric estimates

The occurrence of Grt as relatively undeformed coronas around Spl is indicative of syn- to post-kinematic prograde metamorphism. Peak conditions under eclogite-facies conditions have been calculated at 1.6-1.8 GPa and 780-800 °C (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, Tilhac et al. 2016). Similar conditions are recorded by the late pyroxenite and Grt-rich dykes (Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991) which were probably intruded near peak conditions.

Amphibolitization of the peridotites and pyroxenites suggests an episode of retrograde metamorphism (and hydration). Corresponding P-T conditions have not been calculated in the ultramafic massifs, but probably correspond to amphibolite-facies conditions (~0.8 GPa, 500°C; Abalos et al. 2003) documented in other HP units of the complex, although unpublished calculations based on Amp compositions yield lower pressure (~0.4 GPa).

### 3.4 Age constraints

> I am not sure the table are needed, but I thought they could be useful.

As in the other HP units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex, two main age clusters have been identified in the ultramafic massifs. The first cluster is found at ~390 Ma; (**Table 1**), particularly well documented by zircon (Zrn) and rutile (Rt) U-Pb ages of 383-392 Ma, notably in a Grt clinopyroxenite vein in the *Uzal* massif (Peucat et al. 1990, Santos Zalduegui et al. 1996, Ordóñez Casado et al. 2001). It overlaps with Rb-Sr and K-Ar ages of 386-401 Ma obtained from a 150-m drilled core in the *Herbeira* peridotites (Van Calsteren et al. 1979, Kuijper et al. 1982) and a U-Pb isochron age of 400 ± 26 Ma reported for peridotites and pyroxenites as well as Grt-bearing mafic rocks which also yielded Sm-Nd isochron ages of 392-394 Ma (Santos et al. 2002). This age cluster is coeval with the HP-HT metamorphic event documented by U-Pb and <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar ages of 382-395 Ma in the adjacent HP units (Santos Zalduegui et al. 1996, Ordóñez Casado et al. 2001, Gómez Barreiro et al. 2007), associated with a well documented Devonian subduction. In the ultramafic massifs, it also dates the peak of HP metamorphism and corresponds to the formation of cross-cutting pyroxenite veins and other intrusive bodies, among which a pegmatitic granite intruded into the *Uzal* peridotite provide a minimum age for the ultramafic massifs at 387-388 Ma (Santos Zalduegui et al. 1996)

A second age cluster at ~500 Ma (**Table 2**) was first recognized by Rb-Sr ages of 477 ± 122 Ma for the *Herbeira* peridotites (Van Calsteren et al. 1979) and Sm-Nd ages of 493-506 Ma for the pyroxenites (Santos et al. 2002). It was recently confirmed by Sm–Nd ages (Tilhac et al. 2017) of 459–515 Ma, including an external isochron calculated for all types of pyroxenite at 474 ± 59 Ma, which remarkably coincides with an isochron age of 459 ± 84 Ma calculated for three different subsections of an increasingly LREE-enriched sample whose enrichment relates to late-magmatic metasomatism (Tilhac et al. 2016). This age cluster is comparable to U-Pb zircon ages of 480-520 Ma reported for the protoliths of the other HP units (Peucat et al. 1990, Ordóñez Casado et al. 2001). Tilhac et al. (2017) interpreted these ages as representing minimum estimates, owing to the potential partial reset of the Sm-Nd system associated with amphibolitization. Second-stage Nd model ages of 502–762 Ma indeed suggest that the Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites may well be older than 500 Ma (Tilhac et al. 2017, 2020). This is consistent with a Re-depletion model age (τRD) of 588 Ma. A Re-Os isochron age at 838 ± 42 Ma was also obtained from the samples most preserved from amphibolitization and supergene alteration (Tilhac et al. 2020), which preferentially affected low-Mg# low Cu/S pyroxenites (_i.e._ Re addition).

## 4. Other HP units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex

> I have made some changes here to make consistent with the rest of the guide. In particular, I have tried to shorten the names of the different granulite subtypes and to make their description more concise, as I thought it could be a bit confusing for non-specialists. Please feel free to modify if these are not correct. I have also tried to make a consistent use of the formation names, following the structural description of the different units in the Geological setting.

### 4.1 Granulites

**Field aspect & petrography**. Granulites outcrop as the *Bacariza* formation between the *Concepenido* eclogites to the E and the ultramafic massifs to the W (**Fig_map-complex**), although most geological maps also show granulites directly in contact with high-pressure paragneisses in the southern part of the complex. The contacts between the granulites and the ultramafic massifs have been described as either ductile thrusts (Abalos et al. 1996, Azcárraga et al. 2002, Ábalos et al. 2003, Puelles et al. 2005) or non-tectonic lithological conformities, thus potentially representing a crust-mantle transition (Galán & Marcos, 1997, Galán & Marcos, 2000, Marcos et al. 2002). The granulites are characterised by the lack of Opx and a high Grt content, with very variable Cpx, Amp and Plg contents. The *Bacariza* formation also includes utramafic cumulates (pyrigarnites, hornblendites) that occur along the contact with the *Uzal* peridotite massif to the W and with the layered Opx-free granulites to the E. They occur as a continuous layer of Si-poor, Fe- and Ti-rich rocks with Cpx, Grt and Amp (pargasite) in varying proportions. Ultramafic occurrences are also found embedded in the main granulites forming elongated lenses parallel to the tectonic layering. In the nearby *Candelaria* amphibolites formation, Opx-free Grt granulites occur with higher Amp content compared to *Bacariza* granulites. They also contain Fe-Ti-rich ultramafic rocks, notably near *Monte Agüdo*, (**Fig_map-complex**) where they are surrounded by the Opx-free Amp-rich granulites and a tectonic contact to the S, so their overlying unit is not observed. On most maps, *Candelaria* amphibolites are in contact with high-pressure paragneisses and other low-pressure units along tectonic contacts.

> I am not sure whether you meant to refer to the main map of the complex here, or to another map more sepcific to the granulites.

Cabo Ortegal granulites are mostly mafic to felsic opx-free garnet granulites. They exhibit a broad compositional variation, with different facies distinguished by various authors. Apart from volumetrically minor and exotic types (leptynitic gneisses, calcite-rich granulites, and Mg-rich granulites (Galán and Marcos, 2000), we here consolidate five main types below based on their silica content, ranging from ultramafic to acidic compositions:

> Add Fig_granulite-facies

> Add Fig_cumulates-in-carbonates?

- *Ultramafic Fe-Ti cumulates*. These Si-poor rocks are coarse- to medium-grained bi- or tri-mineralic (Grt-Cpx-Prg) when fresh, with Pl+Qtz content < 5%. They range all the way from pyrigarnites composed mainly of Cpx-Grt, to hornblendite composed mainly of Amp.

> Add Fig_cumulates-arclogites.

- *Grt-rich mafic granulites*. These rocks are coarse-to medium-grained with > 5 % Amp. It is the dominant granulite facies, commonly referred to as layered granulites due to the strong layering produced by the contrast between mafic and Plg-rich layers. Cpx vary from augite to omphacite, and amphiboles from pargasite to pargasitic hornblende.

> Add Fig_mafic-granulites.

- *Grt-rich amphibolites*. These rocks are also coarse- to medium-grained layered granulites but almost Cpx-free. They occur with intermediate rocks that occasionally show evidence of partial melting.

- *Grt-bearing trondhjemitic gneisses*: These acidic rocks are volumetrically less abundant but not rare. They are observed crystallised _in situ_ or as centimetre-wide veins cutting through the layering where partial melting is observed in mafic and intermediate granulites.

- *High-pressure migmatitic gneisses*: Also referred to as granulitic orthogneiss, these mafic to intermediate composition rocks outcrop between the *Limo* and *Herbeira* ultramafic massifs (**Fig_map-complex**).

**Protolith interpretations**. Various origins  have been proposed for these rocks, including: (1) residues of deep anatexis (Drury, 1980), (2) upper crust of a volcanic arc close to a continental margin or continental tholeiites (Peucat et al. 1990), (3) fractionation of melt crystals derived from a primitive mantle source (Gravestock 1992), or (4) a stratiform gabbroic complex at the base of continental crust (Galán and Marcos 1997). Although there is no consensus all interpretations so far suggest a sub-continental or arc-related tectonic environment.

**Thermobarometric estimates**. The maximum pressure has been established in the high-pressure migmatites to be between 1.9-2.3 GPa at temperatures between 815-865°C (Beranoaguirre et al. 2020). These pressures are equivalent to those reached in the *Concepenido* eclogites, but at relatively higher temperatures. Mafic granulites provide peak conditions of 1.6-2.0 GPa and 740-950 °C depending on the method (Gil Ibarguchi et al. 1990, 2000; Galán and Marcos, 2000; Puelles et al. 2005; Spránitz et al. 2023). Ultramafic cummulates provided peak conditions of 1.7 GPa and 800 °C (Gil Ibarguchi et al. 1991).

**Age constraints**. U-Pb geochronology (zircon, titanite, rutile) provides two age groups. The main one gives ages of 372-392 Ma and is interpreted as the peak of HP metamorphism closely followed by partial melting events. Migmatization of the granulites is dated by U/Pb on zircons from a leucosome pod at 397-390 Ma (Fernández-Suárez et al. 2007). The other cluster gives ages between 459-497 Ma, interpreted by most authors as the age of the magmatic protoliths, although it could refer to an early metamorphic event (Fernández-Suárez et al. 2002).

### 4.2 Eclogites 

**Field aspect & petrography**. Cabo Ortegal eclogites form a continuous band of about 20 km long, the *Concepenido* formation, among the longest eclogite outcrop in the world (Ábalos, 1997) with a minimum thickness of 100 m (mostly 500-700 m). They are sandwiched between Opx-free garnet granulites to the W and high-pressure paragneises to the E, with which they are partly associated (**Fig_map-complex**).

Fresh eclogite samples have 40-55% Omp, 25-35% Grt, 2-10% Qtz, ≤ 10% Zo, 4-7% Amp, 1-3% Rt and ≤ 1% Ph. Locally, Grt​ can dominate (up to 85%) forming garnet-rich centimetric bands. Most eclogites are however Zo-Amp eclogites and Amph eclogites. Three types are distinguished (Mendia, 1996):

- *Common (_i.e._ volumetrically dominant) eclogites*. This facies varies from massive (lacking lineation and exhibiting weak foliation) to strongly deformed (mylonitic LS-tectonites). Garnets typically range from 1 to 3 mm in size, but can exceptionally exceed 2 cm.

- *Ky-bearing eclogites*. These are strongly deformed Ky-bearing, lighter-coloured eclogites that contain garnets and clinopyroxenes ranging from several millimetres to centimetres (exceptionally up to 6 cm).

- *Ferrotitaniferous eclogites*. These make less than 5% of the total volume and differ from common eclogites only in their richer Fe-Ti compositions.

Eclogites show tight km-scale folds inferred from geological mapping (also visible in some cases on a scale of hundreds of metres). Hand samples range from massive to LS-type mylonites in bands of tens of centimeters. These mylonites are usually enriched in Zo and Amp relative to their precursor, indicating wet HP-HT deformation.

**Protolith interpretations**. This formation is interpreted as a metamorphosed piece of oceanic crust (N-MORB-like diabasic dykes and gabbros), potentially affected by significant continental contamination (Gravestock, 1992), but the existence of felsic rocks generated during decompressive partial melting complicates the distinction of former lithologies and compositions (Albert et al. 2012).

**Thermobarometric estimates**. Eclogite conditions peaked at ~1.7-2.3 GPa with a thermal maximum between 770-800 °C (Mendia 2000, Mendia et al. 2001) in both common and Ky-bearing eclogites. Lowest P-T conditions during retrogression record amphibolitisation and Pl-in at ~600 °C and 1.2-1.6 GPa (Mendia, 2000).

**Age constraints**. Zircon U-Pb dating in eclogites reveals an age cluster at around 390 Ma, interpreted as the time of eclogitization. Older ages between 495 and 470 Ma are interpreted as ages of the mafic protoliths for the common and Ky-bearing eclogites.

### 4.3 High-pressure gneisses

**Field aspect & petrography**. High-pressure gneisses occur as two mappable units: the *Banded* and the *Chímparra* gneisses. Depending on the authors, these two units are interpreted either as distinct or as the same formation on geological maps. Here, we considered them together. Both units are indeed mainly composed of strongly deformed Grt and Ky-bearing quartzo-feldspathic gneisses that include lenses of retrogressed eclogites, Grt pyroxenites and granulites. They also both feature evidence of partial melting and are strongly deformed. The *Banded gneiss* differs in including tonalitic orthogneisses and rare occurrences of coronitic metagabbros.

**Protolith interpretations**. The *Chímparra gneiss* is interpreted as originating from pelitic and semi-pelitic (graywackes) sediments with minor calc-silicate and mafic inclusions (Fernández, 1994), while the *Banded gneiss* protoliths are interpreted as a shallow crustal volcano-sedimentary sequence intruded punctually by igneous bodies (Albert, 2017).

The *Banded gneiss* formation is interpreted as metasedimentary gneisses with abundant mafic and rare ultramafic inclusions (Vogel, 1967, Gil Ibarguchi et al. 1990), representing a shallow pelitic and greywacke volcano-sedimentary sequence (Albert, 2017), intruded punctually by igneous mafic bodies (now eclogites) and minor granites and tonalities (now orthogneisses). The gabbroic melts were variously differentiated from homogeneous tholeiitic parental melts (Bernard-Griffiths et al. 1985, Peucat et al. 1990).

**Thermobarometric estimates**. The *Chímparra* gneiss yields a metamorphic peak at 1.5-1.7 GPa and 800-900 °C (Fernández, 1994; Fernández and Marcos, 1997).

**Age constraints**. Zircon provenance studies indicate that the sediments must be younger than 515 ± 15 Ma. Felsic dykes intruded into the *Banded gneiss* yield concordant Zrn and Mnz U-Pb dates of 475-485 Ma, interpreted as the age of the dyke intrusion into the sediments (Fernández et al. 2016). Accordingly, the paragneisses represent middle to late Cambrian sediments. On the other hand, U-Pb ages on zircon, monazite and rutile in leucosomes date the sediments migmatisation at 394-382 Ma, coinciding with U-Pb zircon ages in the eclogite lenses (393 Ma) and the orthogneiss (395 Ma) hosted in the *Banded gneiss*.

## 5 Tectonic summary

> I agree that a summary is a great idea. This is an attempt I made, also using this section to introduce the different deformation episodes, related to the P-T paths. This summary is certainly missing many things, but perhaps the most importan to add would be some discussion of how and when were assembled the HP units. We could also link this aspect to highlight the different geodynamic models.
 
We attempt below to provide a brief summary of the origin and evolution of the ultramafic massifs that takes into account field observations, tectono-thermal and geochronological constraints provided by the different HP units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex. The geodynamic context of interest is here the Gondwanan-Laurussian convergence (**Fig_geodynamics**), which is particularly well constrained in NW Iberia thansk to the absence of Alpine-related strike-slip faults.

### 5.1 Magmatic history: a peri-Gondwanan Cadomian arc

Many lines of evidence indicate that the formation of the ultramafic massifs (in particular, most of the lithological heterogeneity of *Herbeira*) is related to magmatic activity in a subduction zone. The layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association more specifically suggests an arc root environment (Moreno et al. 2001, Tilhac et al. 2016), similarly to the origin proposed for the chromitites of the nearby Bragança Complex in Portugal (Bridges et al. 1995). Many lithological features of the *Herbeira* massif are similar to the Jijal ultramafic section of the Kohistan arc complex in Pakistan, where pyroxenites preserving dunite lenses have also been interpreted as partial replacement of peridotite (Burg et al., 1998; Garrido et al., 2007). Accordinglty, the chromitites from Cabo Ortegal and Bragança compositionally overlap those of the Jijal Complex (Moreno et al. 2001).

It remains unclear, however, whether the layered pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association formed near the crust-mantle boundary (Moreno et al. 2001) or within the mantle (Girardeau et al. 1989, Tilhac et al. 2016), for instance at the expense of permeability and/or viscosity barrier such as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). The latter interpretation is here prefered to the former which is conditioned to the existence of a questionable fault, so-called the Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF), which would separate the *Herbeira* massif into a mantle tectonite to the E and the layered cumulate sequence to the W (Moreno et al. 2001). This aspect will be discussed in more detail on site (**Stop 7**).

Overall, the magmatic history described above is consistent with the activity of Cambro-Ordovician (at _ca._ 500 Ma) to Neoproterozoic arc, potentially corresponding to the incipient stage of a Cadomian arc built on a rifted margin of Gondwana (Tilhac et al., 2017), as previously invoked in NW (Andonaegui et al., 2016) and SW Iberia (_e.g._ Rojo-Pérez et al. 2024, Novo-Fernandez et al. 2024). In the Cabo Ortegal Complex. such reworking of a Gondwanan margin is compatible with the preservation of Paleoproterozoic to Archean Hf model ages (Tilhac et al. 2020), which overlap with prominent peaks of zircon U-Pb ages at around ~2.1 and ~2.7 Ga intepreted as evidence for an arc development next to the Western African Craton. This interpretation is compatible with the age-corrected (at 390 Ma) radiogenic isotope data for the pyroxenites, which include moderately enriched (_i.e._ EM1) Pb and Sr (Gravestock 1992, Santos et al., 2002, Tilhac et al. 2017) and variously decoupled Hf-Nd with ε<sub>Hf(i)</sub> exceeding + 100 (Tilhac et al. 2020) over fairly homogeneous ε<sub>Nd(i)</sub> of 0 to +7.5 (Gravestock 1992, Santos et al., 2002, Tilhac et al. 2017).

> A summary of the isotopic data could be useful here. 

Arc magmatism on the Gondwanan margin facing the Tornquist (or possibly the Iapetus) Ocean is further supported by detrital zircons derived from the West African craton (Santos Zalduegui et al. 1995, Albert et al. 2014, Roper, 2016). In the Iberian Autochthon, thick sedimentary sequences due to high rates of subsidence and the voluminous volcanics of the *Ollo de Sapo* formation also record early-Ordovician extension as a consequence of continental rifting and the separation of the ensialic arc from the Gondwanan margin (**Fig_geodynamics**; Martinez Catalan et al. 2009).

### 5.2 Prograde tectonothermal evolution: the Devonian subduction

All the HP units of the Cabo Ortegal Complex record a HP episode D<sub>1</sub> (Ábalos et al. 2003) ascribed to a Devonian subduction (at _ca._ 390 Ma). In the ultramafic massifs, it is recorded by a mylonitic foliation near tectonic contacts and extremely elongated sheath folds developed during thrusting of the massifs over the underlying granulites. Until recently, these folds depicting the style of deformation in deep subduction settings (Ábalos et al. 2003) had been recognized in all the units of the Upper Allochthon (Azcárraga et al. 2002), except in the *Limo* and *Herbeira* massifs. *Limo* was initially described as structurally homogeneous (Ben Jamaa, 1988, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, García Izquierdo et al. 2011) due to the strong alteration of most outcrops inland. However, good exposures of harzburgites were found in the NW cliffs revealing large-scale stacking of extremely elongated sheath folds (Puelles et al. 2012). Similar folds were then found affecting both peridotites and pyroxenites in the *Herbeira* massif (Tilhac et al. 2016, Tilhac 2017), indicating that the massif underwent D<sub>1</sub> as an entity, and that formation of the main pyroxenites predates this deformation episode. D<sub>1</sub> was coeval or rapidly followed by the peak of eclogite-facies metamorphism well documented in all the HP units. In the ultramafic massifs, it corresponds to the appearance of Grt in massive websterites as well limited partial melting evidenced by rare cross-cutting pyroxenite veins (Peucat et al., 1990) and intrusive granite bodies (Santos et al., 1996).

**Fig_sheath-folds**. Sheath folds affecting harzburgites near seal level at *Punta Robaliceira* (**a**) as well pyroxenites and dunites in the lower part of Herbeira cliffs **(b)**, as shown in the map of the *Herbeira* massif (**Fig_map-Herbeira**). 

In addition, the ultramafic massifs have experienced high-temperature shear deformation D<sub>HT</sub> (Ábalos et al. 2003) at > 1000°C which predates D<sub>1</sub> (**Fig_P-T-t-paths**). It is recorded by A-type (Jung & Karato, 2001) lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) in Ol, as evidenced by early petrofabric studies (Ben Jamaa, 1988, Girardeau & Gil Ibarguchi, 1991, Girardeau et al. 1990) and confirmed by EBSD techniques applied to the *Limo* (Puelles et al. 2012) and *Herbeira* massifs (Henry et al. 2017, Henry 2018). This deformation episode is responsible for a tectonic foliation parallel to the compositional layering as well isoclinal folding and boudinage, particularly outlined by pyroxenites (**Fig_HT-deformation**).

**Fig_HT-deformation**. Representative examples of high-temperature deformation features (Tilhac, 2017): typical boudinage of a pyroxenite layer in the *Herbeira* cliffs (**a**) and isoclinal fold outlined by a pyroxenite layer (**b**).
 
Tilhac et al. (2016) suggested that the above sequence of HT deformation (_i.e._ potentially asthenospheric), followed by high-shear strain deformation typical of deep subduction settings and HP metamorphism corresponds to the delamination of the arc root followed by its incorporation into a subduction zone. Foundering may have occurred as a consequence of the negative buoyancy induced by the presence of large amount of ultramafic pyroxenites, denser the ambient mantle (Müntener et al. 2001), as well as that of utramafic cumulates such as pyrigarnites in the *Bacariza* formation. The latter lithologies, also known as "arclogites", are indeed considered as some of the most likely candidates to undergo delamination in the context of arc roots (Ducea et al. 2021). The Cabo Ortegal Complex could thus represent a unique example of a delaminated arc root.

### 5.2 Exhumation an emplacement

Fast exhumation seems to have rapidly followed the HP-HT event (~1 GPa in < 10 Ma; Albert et al. 2012). There is little record of the related deformation episodes in the ultramafic massifs, apart from the isoclinal folding of the *Uzal* peridotites and *Bacariza* granulites. This episode (D<sub>2</sub>) has mainly been reconstructed from the tectonothermal evolution of the eclogite-facies *Banded* gneiss (**Fig_exhumation-stages**) and cross-correlations with other structures, notably from the Órdenes Complex (Martínez Catalán et al. 2002). It corresponds to the exhumation and underplating of the HP-HT units to form a unique assemblage at _ca._ 375 Ma (Ábalos et al. 2003, Albert et al. 2012), after 10-20 My within a subduction conduit (Beaumont et al. 1999), in good agreement with exhumation rates predicted by numerical models of syn-convergent extrusion (Chemenda et al. 1995, Doin & Henry, 2001, Warren et al. 2008, Beaumont et al. 2009).

**Fig_exhumation-stages**. Different stages of exhumation of the HP units interpreted from the tectonothermal evolution of the eclogite-facies gneisses (Albert et al. 2012): **a.** development of a regional mylonitic foliation; **b.** syn-convergence extensional detachments and **c.** recumbent folds and thrusts; **d.** idealized cross-section of the Cabo Ortegal Complex.

Several observations indicate that the peridotites were still relatively hot during D<sub>2</sub> (Gayk & Kleinschrodt, 2000, Azcárraga et al. 2002, Ábalos et al. 2003). For instance, near the contact with the *Uzal* peridotites, the *Chimparra* gneisses provide extensive evidence of partial melting dated at 391 ± 8 Ma (Ordóñez Casado et al. 2001) and textures resembling those of high-grade contact metamorphism.

Development of recumbent folds and of a basal thrust (D<sub>3</sub>) accompanied retrograde metamorphism under amphibolite-facies conditions (including amphibolitization of the hydrated peridotites and pyroxenites). D<sub>3</sub> recumbent folds are additionally affected by upright folds without axial planar foliation (D<sub>4</sub>) such as the large open synform observed in *Bacariza* granulites and in the *Herbeira* massif. This last episode occurred under greenschist-facies conditions (Ábalos et al. 2003). Final emplacement of upper allochthonous units on the Iberian parautochthon occurred at _ca._ 360 Ma (Dallmeyer et al. 1997).

### Day 1: Herbeira massif (September 30<sup>th</sup>, full day)

The day focusses on the *Herbeira* massif, which is the largest and most lithologically heterogeneous ultramafic massif of the Cabo Ortegal Complex (**Fig_map-Herbeira**). It will be split into two main parts.

- In the morning, we will first walk approx. 1 km from the *Vixía Herbeira* lookout along the edge of the *Herbeira* cliffs to get an overview of the lithological diversity of actual cliffs in much more accessible outcrops.
- After lunch at a nearby lookout in the *Uzal* peridotite massif (15-min drive), we will do a 2-km return walk along a dirt road to observe some of the intriguing features that occur near the tectonic contact onto granulites to the SW and reach the harzburgites that constitute the dominant lithology of the massif inland, as well as of the other two massifs of the complex (Limo and Uzal).

**Fig_map-Herbeira**. Geological map of the Herbeira massif (Tilhac et al. 2016, Tilhac 2017, and references therein) showing (1) sheath-fold deformation cross-cutting lithological contacts and (2) the serpentinized and/or amphibolitized area surrounding the gradual contact between dunites and harzburgites, along the axial surface of the synform. Fault lines correspond either to strike-slip faults (continuous lines) or contacts with granulites (thrust patterns). Outline of the dunite body to the E is modified after Puelles et al. (2012). Note that the existence of this dunite relies mostly on an open pit "dunite" mine (*Mina David*) exploited by *Pasek Minerales* as part of the traditional exploitation of the *Herbeira* massif for refractory material used in thermal power plant (Pereira et al. 2008).

#### Stop 1: "Vixía Herbeira" lookout

The first stop of the day is the lookout of the *Vixía Herbeira* (613 m), the highest point of the *Serra de la Capelada* and one of the highest sea cliffs in Europe (**Fig_herbeira-lookout**). Its iconic landmark, the *Garita de Herbeira* (literally "Herbeira’s watchtower"), a stone construction from the 18<sup>th</sup> century, was part of a series of coastal watch posts. The current building, entirely made of ultramafic rocks, dates from 1805 and was renovated in 2003.

**Structure of the Herbeira massif**. From this point, we will introduce the main lithological variations of the massif (**Fig_map-Herbeira**):

- To the N, down the *Punta Robaliceira*, serpentinized harzburgites occur along the shore line along with minor pyroxenites and wehrlites. Thanks to marine erosion, these rocks exhibit spectacular sheath folds (Tilhac, 2017 + thesis) similar to those described in the *Limo* massif (Puelles et al. 2012) marked by a weakly defined foliation and a well-developed linear fabric.
- To the NW, below us, abundant pyroxenites make up to 80-90 % of a ~3 km-long, 300 m-thick lenticular domain exposed in the *Herbeira* cliffs. Individual layers may reach up to 3m in thickness with a lateral extent exceeding 100 m. They alternate mostly with dunites, particularly in the top and middle part of the pyroxenite-rich domain, and with harzburgites in its lower parts. This body preserve the best and most abundant pyroxenite outcrops of the complex, and among the largest amounts of pyroxenite in orogenic massifs worldwide. It has notably been investigated in detail through sampling of several cross-sections sampled by Girardeau et al. (1989, 1990, 1991) and Tilhac et al. (2016, 2017, 2020). Unfortunately, walking down the steeply dipping cliffs (about 65º) is not suitable for a large party. Detailed study of these cross-sections suggest that the actual shape of the pyroxenite-rich domain may be more complex. Most pyroxenites are found between altitudes ~150 and ~350 m below us, whereas they are found at a higher altitude in the *Punta Robaliceira*'s section (~ 400-500 m), and to a lesser extent at ~300m. It may thus consist of a pile of at least two connected lenticular bodies of varying extent. Their detailed characterization is complicated by blocks separated by NW-trending Alpine faults, glacial geomormology (Alberti 2023) and recent landlisdes, some of which are currently active and monitored (Horacio et al. 2019a & b).
- To the W, in the lower part of the cliffs, sheath folds have been described in the lower part of the pyroxenite-rich domain (Tilhac et al. 2016, Tilhac 2017) indicating that the *Herbeira* massif probably underwent the related deformation episode (D<sub>1</sub>) as an entity, likely constrained by the presence of abundant pyroxenites, rheologically competent with respect to surrounding peridotites. Importantly, this observation provide a robust fiel confirmation that the main pyroxenites pre-date the Devonian subduction episode.
- To the NE, near the top of the ridge of *Punta Robaliceira*, a Grt-rich, 3 to 5 m-thick mafic layer was described by Girardeau and Gil Ibarguchi (1991). These mafic rocks are most likely unrelated to the main pyroxenites.
- To the S of the *Vixía Herbeira*, in a broad area along the cliff edge, a dunite-dominated domain outcrops associated with relatively abundant chromitites and locally wehrlitic bands.
- To the SE, a dominantly harzburgitic plateau represents the mantle tectonic which covers most of the wind farm inland. Thin pyroxenite layers and minor dunite represent <10 % in volume in this area which resembles exposures of the *Limo* and *Uzal* massif.

#### Stop 2: Type-1 pyroxenite

This outcrop (**Fig_type1-outcrop**) is an example of pyroxenites with dunite lenses (type-1 of Tilhac et al. 2016), which are Ol-bearing clinopyroxenites and websterites.

<img src="fieldguide_figures/type1-outcrop.jpg"
style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 500px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_type1-outcrop**. Outcrop of type-1 pyroxenite in the upper dunite, near the edge of the *Herbeira* cliffs. Photo credit: M.A. Lopez-Sanchez.

They are, along with type 4, the most primitive type of pyroxenites in Cabo Ortegal, with 20-24% MgO, 2-3% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and high Mg# of 87–89 (Cpx Mg# > 0.91). Type-1 pyroxenites plot along the Fo-An join within the nepheline-normative, silica-deficient field in the Fo-CaTs-Qz projection. As in other orogenic pyroxenites, this trend towards the Fo apex is ascribed to melt-peridotite interaction (Bodinier et al. 2008, Lambart et al. 2012). Type-1 pyroxenites are interpreted as products of partial replacement of peridotites upon interaction with a Si-undersaturated magma, as suggested by their high Cpx/Opx ratios which point to crystallization along a Cpx–Ol cotectic line. The incomplete remplacement reaction is supported by the preservation of dunite lenses within type-1 pyroxenites and their mostly LREE-depleted (**Fig_REE-type1**), spoon-shaped patterns with flat heavy REE (HREE) and limited LILE enrichment.

#### Stop 3.1. Chromitite schlieren in dunite

After passing by an isoclinal fold (**Fig_isoclinal-pyroxenite**), we reach the area of **Stop 3**, where we will observe the first chromtiite of the day and most of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenite subtypes.

The main outcrop of **Stop 3.1** is a sequence of several irregular layers or schlieren hosted in dunite. They extend laterally over several m with an individual thickness ranging from single grains to 3-4 cm (**Fig_chromitite-outcrop**). This occurrence corresponds to the semi-massive (<80 % Chr), high-Cr# (0.75–0.82) chromitite (type II) of García-Tudela et al. (2024), which was classified in a broad group of Chr-rich dunite (<75 % Chr) by Moreno et al. (2001). The origin of Cabo Ortegal chromtities will be further discussed in **Stop 4** and **6**.

#### Stop 3.2. Type-2 pyroxenite.

Walking W from **Stop 3.1**, we encounter among other pyroxenite layers an example (not pictured here) of massive websterite (type-2 pyroxenites of Tilhac et al. 2016). Most occurrences of this type are found in the central part of the pyroxenite-rich domain where massive outcrops reaching several m in thickness can be observed (_e.g._ **Fig_massive-pyroxenite**).

<img src="fieldguide_figures/massive-pyroxenite.jpg"
style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 500px; height: auto;"/>

**Fig_massive-pyroxenite**. Among the best example of (~3-m thick) massive Spl-/Grt-facies pyroxenite (sample CO-006; Tilhac et al. 2016) from the *Herbeira* cliffs (not included in this excursion; Tilhac, 2017).

These pyroxenites are more evolved with 20-21% MgO, 3-6% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Cpx Mg# of 0.88-0.92 (**Fig_mineral-chemistry-**) . Type-2 pyroxenites plot along the En-CaTs join on the Fo-CaTs-Qz diagram, similarly to experimental cumulates of hydrous basaltic andesites (Müntener et al. 2001). Their Ol-free, lower Cpx/Opx modal compositions suggest that they either crystallized from an initially Si-saturated magma or that they represent a more advanced product (_i.e._ at higher melt/rock ratio) of melt-peridotite interaction than type-1 pyroxenites, upon which Ol was entirely consumed by the peritectic reaction Fo + Si-rich melt = En at relatively low pressure (<1.2 GPa). This interpretation is consistent with the presence of late-magmatic Amp crystallized upon cooling from hydrous residual melts responsible for the metasomatic enrichment of the pyroxenites (similarly to the percolative fractional crystallization model of Harte et al. 1993). Type-2 pyroxenites indeed exhibit variable LREE enrichments over nearly flat HREE (**Fig_REE-type2**) negatively correlated with Nd isotopes (Tilhac et al., 2017). Accordingly, outward percolation of these melts is likely to be responsible for the positive correlation observed between the amount of pyroxenites and the extent of LREE enrichment in the host harzburgites (Gravestock, 1992).

#### Stop 3.3. Type-3 pyroxenite.

Continuing towards the cliff edge, we reach an example (not pictured here) of strongly foliated (type-3 pyroxenites of Tilhac et al. 2016). These pyroxenites are characterized by the highest modal proportion of Amp (8-43 %) among Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites, compared to type-1 and type-2 which contain 6-14% and 5-26%, respectively. Except the higher Amp content, their whole-rock (WR) major and modal compositions overlap with type-1 and -2 pyroxenites (**Fig_mineral-chemistry-pyroxenites**), except higher Na<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>O (up to 0.8-0.9 %) and systematically LREE-enriched patterns with negative MREE-to-HREE slopes (**Fig_REE-type3**). Most type-3 pyroxenites mimic the high MgO of type-1 while other reach similarly high Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> than type-2 pyroxenites.

**Fig_REE-type3**. Chondrite-normalized REE compositions of Cpx and Amp from Cabo Ortegal type-3 pyroxenites (Tilhac et al. 2016).

Type-3 pyroxenites are mainly interpreted as the deformed and hydrated (amphibolitized) products of the other two types, preferentially type-1 pyroxenites where dunite lenses and layers provided preferential pathways for fluids percolation and deformation localization (**Fig_amphibolitization**). Note that where sheath folds affect pyroxenites (in the lower part of the pyroxenite-rich domain), the latter are systematically of type 3, and particularly amphibolitized. This observation suggests that most of the hydration was syn-kinematic of the high-shear strain deformation episode (D<sub>1</sub>) and that metamorphic amphibolitization (which produced undeformed idiomorphic Amp) is mostly post-kinematic and contemporaneous to the regional amphibolite-facies metamoprhism during exhumation stage D<sub>3</sub>.

#### Stop 4.1: Massive chromitite in dunite

We reach the area around **Stop 4** where most of the chromitite outcrops of the *Herbeira* massif are encountered. This area was mapped in detail by Monterrubio Perez (1991) (**Fig_map-Monterrubio-Perez**), who first discovered platiniferous chromitite here as part of his work on mineralization in ultramafic rocks of the Variscan belt of Spain. Chromium and Pt concentrations were measured along trenches dug by the Empresa Nacional Adaro de Investigaciones Mineras (ENADIMSA), one the ancestors of the Spanish geological survey. Subsequent investigation of these chromitites by Moreno (1999) revealed concentrations >13 000 ppb ΣPGE, with Pt and Pd being much more concentrated (10 900 ppb) than Os, Ir and Ru (<1365 ppb).

> Perhaps to be replaced by a full, cleaned version of his Figure 5.16, as it includes the nice cross-sections from Girardeau and wider map of the whole upper dunite. It would actually be nice to digitalize it as we could show on this same map all the itinerary of the day. I will try if I find the time.

The main outcrop of **Stop 4.1** is massive chromitite hosted in dunite. It is one of the most spectacular of the *Herbeira massif* as it features oblique cross sections through a sequence of irregular chromitite layers sandwiched between layered pyroxenites and dunites  (**Fig_chromitites**). This occurrence corresponds to the massive (>80 % Chr), intermediate-Cr# (0.60–0.66) chromitite (type I) of García-Tudela et al. (2024), classified as chromitites _sensu stricto_ (_i.e._ >75 % Chr) by Moreno et al. (2001). This outcrop also yielded some of the highest PGE concentrations measured among Cabo Ortegal chromitites.

#### Stop 4.2: Type-4 pyroxenites

About 50-m away from **Stop 4.1**, we encounter among the best examples of type-4 pyroxenites (**Fig_type4-outcrop**). It is noteworthy that this type is relatively abundant in this area, often spatially associated with chromitites, while it is rare in the rest of the *Herbeira* massif except, but to a lesser extent, in the lower dunite exposed in *Punta Robaliceira*.

The field occurrence of type-4 pyroxenites is dominated by very coarse-grained pods that appeared to be wrapped around by the foliation of the host harburgites (**Fig_type4-pods**). This type includes Opx-rich websterites and orthopyroxenites, which exhibit the highest Mg# (and Cr#) and lowest Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> of all types of Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites. Their REE compositions of the Cpx is highly variable, comparable to extremely depleted and enriched endmembers of type-2 pyroxenites.

#### Stop 5: "Chao do Monte" lookout

We will have lunch at the *Chao do Monte* (literally "flatland of the hill") lookout (360 m),  a pasture for cows and horses near the NE edge of the the ultramafic massif of *Uzal*. It provides great views to the NE  towards the granulites and the *Herbeira* cliffs  (**Fig_Uzal-panorama**). To the W, we can also observe the rest of the folded Uzal massif down to the *Playa de Cortés* beach and the *Chimparra*  gneiss outcropping forming the ridge of *Punta Tarroiba* (**Fig_playa-de-cortes**)..

#### Stop 6: Chromitites associated with pyroxenites

This highly heterogeneous outcrop exhibit a folded sequence of dunite interlayered with pyroxenites and various chromitites, occurring both as irregular layers with sharp boundaries and varying thickness (locally forming pods) as well as trails of disseminated grains variously concentrated(**Fig_chromitites-group-b**).

**Fig_chromitites-group-b**. **a.** Overview of the outcrop. **b-c.** Details of the association of chromitite and pyroxenite layres. **d.** Details of varously concentrated disseminated Spl grains in dunite (Tilhac, 2017).

While most massive and semi-massive chromitites hosted in the upper dunite have a relatively high Cr#, comparable to chromite in boninites (Barnes & Roedder, 2001), chromitite samples from this outcrop (groupe-B chromitites of Tilhac, 2017) have a markedly lower Cr#, overlapping with spinel compositions in the pyroxenites (**Fig_spl-summary**).

Now we have seen most of the lithological diversity of the *Herbeira* massif,  we can discuss the compositional variability in Spl and the constraints it provides for the origin of the pyroxenite-dunite-chromitite association. Overall, Spl compositions in the Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites and peridotites show a strong control of both Cr-Al and Fe-Ti trends, resulting in a well-defined Spl gap owing a solvus in the spinel solid solution (Sack & Ghiorso, 1991).
- The Cr-Al trend, commonly observed in mantle terranes and xenoliths and terranes peridotites is mostly seen in type-1 pyroxenites. It is mainly interpreted as the result of subsolidus re-equilibration between Spl and silicates (Barnes & Roeder, 2001). 
- The Fe-Ti trend, commonly observed in mafic intrusions and arc-related ultramafic complexes, is seen in type-2 (and type-3) pyroxenites. It is interpreted as a re-equilibration with evolving residual (trapped) melts. Increasing oxidation state during melt differentiation is also suggested by a coeval increase in V (Pagé & Barnes, 2009) observed in the pyroxenites (Tilhac, 2017).

Compared to peridotites and pyroxenites, the relatively narrow range of Mg# (0.35-0.50) and high Cr contents observed in chromtites indicates more limited re-equilibration processes (except for the lower Cr# of group-B chromitites). Slight differences between massive (type-I) and semi-massive (type-II) chromitites, which were ascribed by Garcia-Tudela et al. (2024) to distinct parental melts, may also reflect variable extent of subsolidus re-equilibration. Massive chromitites are indeed the least likely to suffer from subsolidus re-equilibration with silicates and accordingly overlap with the compositional field of chromite in boninites (Barnes & Roedder, 2001), probably reflecting their actual parental melts.

#### Stop 7: Chlorite harzburgites, garnet pyroxenites & mylonites

> In progress... All what's below are temporary bits copied from my thesis.

**Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF)**. It has been proposed that the *Herbeira* massif consists of two tectonically distinct units separated by a near-vertical fault oriented NW-SE: the Trans-Herbeira Fault (THF; Moreno et al. 2001, García Izquierdo et al. 2011). Evidence compatible with the existence of this fault include high degrees of serpentinization and chrysotile veining (asbestos) to the NE and exposure of horizontally-foliated garnet granulites and vertical foliation adjacent to quartz veins to the SW (Moreno, 1999). In addition, ultramafic rocks exposed in excavations to the NE of the *Vixía Herbeira* are highly brecciated and exhibit a north-dipping lineation and evidence for a dextral shear sense (Moreno, 1999). The THF-affected area is strongly amphibolitized to the NE and serpentinized with abundant sub-vertical garnet-bearing veins to the SW. However, field observations reported by Tilhac (2017) where fresh outcrops are preserved (i.e. to the SW) indicate that the contact between harzburgites and dunites can be observed as gradual: the proportion of opx porphyroclasts increases progressively over a few hundred metres. We thus believe that the area has been affected by metasomatism that overprinted the igneous contact between dunites and harzburgites, and probably post-dates the thrusting of the massif on to the granulites, as evidenced by chlorite-talc-serpentine-rich rocks exposed near the contact with granulites. Faulting might have occurred locally, and at most limited to minor displacement; the THF thus does not represent a major structure. Foliation trajectories indicate that the Herbeira massif is a large and open synformal structure (Ábalos et al. 2003, Girardeau et al. 1990) whose axial plane roughly follows the lithological layering, although it is not possible to directly relate serpentinization, veining and brecciation to the folding episode. However, this structure is to an important extent conditionned by the existence of a questionable lense of dunite, which appears in some geological map also the E border of the massif.

#### Stop 8: Layered pyroxenites (optional)

To wrap up the day, time and weather allowing, we will walk in small groups to see one of the few picturesque outcrops of picturesque pyroxenites layered with dunites accessible without having to hike down the cliffs. The outcrop is located 100 m from the road in a steep but accessible ridge at the top of the *Punta Robaliceira*, another of the previously studied cross-section which exposes a similar association of dunites and pyroxenites (in lesser proportion).
